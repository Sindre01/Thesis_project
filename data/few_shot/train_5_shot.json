The result from the 'Logic Equal' node is connected to the predicate of the 'Std If' node.\n\nIf the predicate evaluates to 'true' (the sublists are equal), the flow proceeds to set the output property 'output' to 'True' and triggers the output trigger 'continue', effectively ending the function execution.

The function should have two outputs: a 'continue' trigger and 'element' of type Number, which is the kth element in the provided list. Inside the function, a local variable is used to store the state of the input property 'k'. This variable is called 'local_k' and is set at the beginning of the flow using the setter node to the value of the input property of 'k'. Then an 'IfExpression' node is used to check if 'k' is equal to 0. If 'k' is 0, trigger the 'continue' output immediately. Otherwise, it gets the 'local_k' variable using a getter node and adjusts for zero-based indexing by using 'Math Sub' to subract 1, and assign this result back to 'local_k', using the setter node. Then, use a 'List GetAt' node to retrieve the element at the updated index from 'list'. The getter node is used for getting the value of the local variable 'local_k'. The retrieved element should be output through the 'element' property. Connect the nodes appropriately: the 'execute' trigger starts the flow and sends the flow of execution to the setter node. The setter node uses input property 'k' and therefore an arrow is created between them. The setter node then sends the flow of execution to the 'Std IfExpression' node, which also takes in the input property 'k'. The node's output trigger 'then' is connected with the output trigger 'continue' of the flow, and the output trigger 'else' is connected to another setter node. The setter node's input property 'new value' is connected to the output property 'result' of the 'Math Sub' node. Lastly, the input propery 'list' and the getter node is connected to the input properties 'list' and 'index' of the 'List GetAt' node. The outpur property 'itemAtIndex' of this node is then connected to the output property 'element' of the user-defined function, which returns the number.",
