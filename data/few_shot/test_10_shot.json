Lastly, it includes an output variable named 'output' and an output trigger named 'continue'.\n Arrows are connected as follows: The input trigger, named 'list', is conencted to the input property 'list' of the 'List GetAt' and the input property 'items' of the 'Std For' node. The 'List GetAt' node gets the items at index zero and the output property, named 'itemAtIndex' is connected to a setter node, which sets the a variable named 'previous'. The input trigger named 'execute' of this user-defined function is connected to the setter node, so that the node is set at the start of the execution flow. After this, the flow of execution is sent to the 'Std For' node, which loops through the 'items' property, which is set to the input property 'list' of this user-defined function. In each iteration, the flow of execution is sent through an 'Std IfExpression' node. This node takes in 'index', 'current' item in the loop and the 'previous' variable, which is stored in the local variable 'previous' and provided by a getter node. The 'Std IfExpression' node checks if index is zero or previous is lower or equal to the previous item, by using this expression 'index == 0 || previous <= current'. If it evaluates to true, the flow of execution is first sent through a setter node, which sets the variable 'previous' to the 'item' provided by 'Std For'. Then the flow of execution is sent back to the input trigger 'next' of the 'Std For' node, which triggers usage of the next item in the list. However, if the 'Std IfExpression' in the for loop evalutes to true, the flow of execution is sent to the output trigger, named 'continue', which exits the for loops. Regardless of outcome, the output property of the user-defined function, is set value of the 'Std IfExpression'.  Then the 'Std For' node loops through the provided  The user-defined function is then created within the main module.",
