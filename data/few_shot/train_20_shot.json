The body of the function contains two inputs: an input trigger named 'execute' and an input property of type List, named 'list'. It also includes the following nodes: one 'List Empty' node to initialize an empty list, for the local varibale 'usedNumbers', several Setter and Getter nodes for managing local variables 'product' and 'usedNumbers', one 'Std For' node to iterate over the 'items' in the input property 'list', one 'List Contains' node to check if an item is already in 'usedNumbers', one 'Std If' node to control flow based on whether an item is unique, one 'Math Mul' node to multiply the current product by the unique item, and one 'List Add' node to add the unique item to 'usedNumbers'. Lastly, it includes an output property named 'output' of type Number and an output trigger named 'continue'.\n\nArrows are connected as follows: The input trigger execute is connected to the Setter node that initializes the variable product to 1.

After updating usedNumbers, the flow continues to a 'Math Mul' node where the current product (retrieved via a Getter node) is multiplied by the current item. The result is stored back into product using another Setter node. The flow then returns to the next input of the 'Std For' node for the next iteration.\nOnce the 'Std For' loop is complete (all items have been processed), the flow proceeds to output the final product through the output property 'output', and the 'continue' output trigger is activated to signal the end of the function execution.

The 'List Slice' node extracts a sublist from 'main_list' using the 'start' and 'end' indices. The sliced sublist is then connected to the 'left' input of the 'Logic Equal' node, while 'sub_list' is connected to the 'right' input. The result from the 'Logic Equal' node is connected to the predicate of the 'Std If' node.\n\nIf the predicate evaluates to 'true' (the sublists are equal), the flow proceeds to set the output property 'output' to 'True' and triggers the output trigger 'continue', effectively ending the function execution. If the predicate evaluates to 'false', the flow proceeds to the 'count' input of the 'Std Count' node to continue with the next iteration.

The function should have two outputs: a 'continue' trigger and 'element' of type Number, which is the kth element in the provided list. Inside the function, a local variable is used to store the state of the input property 'k'. This variable is called 'local_k' and is set at the beginning of the flow using the setter node to the value of the input property of 'k'. Then an 'IfExpression' node is used to check if 'k' is equal to 0. If 'k' is 0, trigger the 'continue' output immediately. Otherwise, it gets the 'local_k' variable using a getter node and adjusts for zero-based indexing by using 'Math Sub' to subract 1, and assign this result back to 'local_k', using the setter node. Then, use a 'List GetAt' node to retrieve the element at the updated index from 'list'. The getter node is used for getting the value of the local variable 'local_k'. The retrieved element should be output through the 'element' property. Connect the nodes appropriately: the 'execute' trigger starts the flow and sends the flow of execution to the setter node. The setter node uses input property 'k' and therefore an arrow is created between them. The setter node then sends the flow of execution to the 'Std IfExpression' node, which also takes in the input property 'k'. The node's output trigger 'then' is connected with the output trigger 'continue' of the flow, and the output trigger 'else' is connected to another setter node. The setter node's input property 'new value' is connected to the output property 'result' of the 'Math Sub' node. Lastly, the input propery 'list' and the getter node is connected to the input properties 'list' and 'index' of the 'List GetAt' node. The outpur property 'itemAtIndex' of this node is then connected to the output property 'element' of the user-defined function, which returns the number.",

The body of the function contains one input property of type Number, called 'n', and one input trigger, called 'execute'. It also includes the following node: one 'Math Floor' node, one 'Math Modulo' node with the divisor set to 10, one 'Math Division' node with the divisor set to 10, one 'Math Addition' node, one 'Std IfExpression' node, local variable creation with the getter and setter nodes, and the current sum_digits function node to be able to do recursive calls. Lastly, it includes an output property of type number and an output trigger, called 'continue'.\n The arrows are connected as follows:  The input property, called n, is connected with arrows to the input property of the 'Math Floor' node. The output property of the 'Math Floor' node, called 'output', is connected with three arrows to the input properties of 'Std IfExpression', 'Math Div' and 'Math Modulo'. The input trigger, called 'execute' is conencted with an arrow to the setter node, which sets the value of a variable sum to the number 0. Then, the flow of execution is futher sent to the 'Std IfExpression' node, which evaluates if 'n <= 0'. If true, then the flow of execution is sent to the output trigger, called 'continue'. If false, the the flow of execution is sent to the current sum_digits node which starts a recursive call, with the input property 'n' set to the result of the 'Math Div' node, which divides n (after going through 'Math Floor') with 10. After the recursive calls, the flow of execution is sent to a setter node, which sets the variable 'sum' to the value of 'Math Add', which add the output of 'sum_digits' and the 'Math Modulo' node with divisor 10. After the varible 'sum' have been set by the setter node, the flow of execution is sent to the ouput trigger 'continue'. At the end of the main flow and all the recursive calls, the output property is returned by connecting it to a 'getter' node, which gets the value of the variable 'sum'.
