      " Documentation: For is a loop construct that can be used to iterate over a list of items. The `trigger` input is used to start the loop, the `reset` input is used to reset the loop, and the `next` input is used to move to the next item in the list. The `items` input is used to provide the list of items to iterate over. The `on item` output trigger is used to signal that an item has been processed, the `done` output trigger is used to signal that the loop has finished, the `item` output property is used to provide the current item, and the `index` output property is used to provide the current index.\n",

      " Documentation: For is a loop construct that can be used to iterate over a list of items. The `trigger` input is used to start the loop, the `reset` input is used to reset the loop, and the `next` input is used to move to the next item in the list. The `items` input is used to provide the list of items to iterate over. The `on item` output trigger is used to signal that an item has been processed, the `done` output trigger is used to signal that the loop has finished, the `item` output property is used to provide the current item, and the `index` output property is used to provide the current index.\n",
