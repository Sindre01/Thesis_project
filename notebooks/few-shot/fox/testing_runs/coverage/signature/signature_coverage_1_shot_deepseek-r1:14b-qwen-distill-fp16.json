                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations easily. Maybe using a different approach with For loop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list in two passes: first find the first odd, then find the first even after that point, or somewhere else in the list.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, during iteration, for each item, check if it's odd and if we haven't found an odd yet\u2014store it. Similarly, check if it's even and store the first one encountered.\n\nWait, but I need to find the first odd and then the first even after that. Or is it just the first occurrence of each regardless of order? The problem says \"the first even and first odd number,\" which implies their positions in the list. So, for example, if the list is [2, 3, 4], the first even is 2, first odd is 3; difference is -1.\n\nSo, I need to find the first occurrence of an odd and the first occurrence of an even, regardless of which comes first in the list. Then subtract them: even - odd.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd.\" So if even comes before odd, it's even minus odd; else, odd minus even? Or is it always even minus odd?\n\nLooking back at the task description: \"the difference of the first even and first odd number.\" The wording suggests (even) - (odd). But I should confirm.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the function will compute evenNumber - oddNumber.\n\nSo, during iteration, for each item:\n\n- If it's the first odd encountered, store it.\n- If it's the first even encountered after that, or if an even comes before any odd, store it as well.\n\nWait, but I need to find both the first even and the first odd in the entire list. So, perhaps during iteration, for each item:\n\n1. Check if it's odd. If yes and we haven't found an odd yet, mark it as the first odd.\n2. Check if it's even. If yes and we haven't found an even yet, mark it as the first even.\n\nOnce both are found, stop processing further items because we only need the first occurrences.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio? Since each iteration is handled by a handler function, which can't maintain state between iterations unless using some external storage or context.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a context object that's passed through each iteration. The handler can modify this context to keep track of whether it has found the first odd and even numbers.\n\nSo, in the Map node's handler, I'll have access to the current item and can update the context accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize a context with flags for whether we've found an odd or even.\n- Iterate through each item in the list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's odd (n % 2 != 0) using Math.Expression.\n   - If it's odd and context.oddFound is false, set context.oddValue to this number and mark oddFound as true.\n   - Similarly, check if it's even (n % 2 == 0). If yes and context.evenFound is false, set context.evenValue and mark evenFound as true.\n   - Once both are found, perhaps break out of the loop early? But Midio doesn't support breaking loops easily. So maybe continue processing until all items are checked.\n\nAfter processing all items, if either odd or even isn't found, handle that case (but assuming they exist per problem statement), then compute the difference as context.evenValue - context.oddValue and return it.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each handler is a separate function, so I can't directly modify variables outside of it. So perhaps using a root context or some other way to pass state between iterations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using two separate passes: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even after that point.\n\nBut that might be more complex. Alternatively, use a For loop with index and iterate through each element, checking for both conditions as we go.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop:\n\n- Use Std.For to iterate over the list.\n- For each item, check if it's odd or even.\n- Keep track of firstOdd and firstEven in variables outside the loop.\n\nBut again, Midio doesn't support local variables in functions easily. So perhaps using a context object that holds these values.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it like this:\n\n1. Use a For loop to iterate through each element in the list.\n2. For each item, check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression nodes.\n3. If it's the first odd encountered, store its value and mark it as found.\n4. Similarly for even.\n5. Once both are found, calculate the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes needed:\n\n- For loop: Std.For\n- Check if a number is odd or even: Math.Expression (n % 2)\n- Logic to check if we've found an odd or even yet: perhaps using variables in the context.\n\nWait, but each iteration of For would have its own handler. So I need a way to carry state between iterations. Maybe using a root context that holds the firstOdd and firstEven values.\n\nSo, in the For loop's",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and set the output.\n\nBut how to manage state between iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables unless using a context node that holds these states.\n\nWait, Midio allows for instance variables in modules. So perhaps within the function module, I can declare properties like first_odd and first_even, and update them as needed during each loop iteration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but actually, we take their values regardless of order. Wait no, because the list is processed in order, so first_even is the first occurrence of even, and first_odd is the first occurrence of odd, regardless of which comes first in the list.\n\nWait, for example, list [2,4,3,5]. First even is 2, first odd is 3. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nAnother example: list [3,5,2,4]. First odd is 3, first even is 2. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nSo regardless of which comes first in the list, it's always (first_even) minus (first_odd).\n\nWait no, wait: the function is to find the difference between the first even and the first odd number. So if the first even is found before the first odd, then it's even minus odd. If the first odd is found before even, then it's still even minus odd? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no: the function should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number in the list, regardless of their order, and compute even - odd.\n\nSo for [3,5,2,4], first_odd is 3, first_even is 2. So difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nFor [2,4,3,5], first_even is 2, first_odd is 3: 2-3=-1.\n\nBut what if the list has no even or odd numbers? Well, perhaps we can assume that the input list contains at least one even and one odd number. Otherwise, the function might return null or some default value, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that both exist.\n\nNow, back to Midio nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on",

But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function.

Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly.

Compute difference: first_odd - first_even.\n\nBut how to implement breaking out of a loop early in Midio? Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration. So, if I can set a flag when the first_odd or first_even is found, and then in the predicate, check that flag to decide whether to continue.\n\nBut again, without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using",

So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but actually, we take their values regardless of order. Wait no, because the list is processed in order, so first_even is the first occurrence of even, and first_odd is the first occurrence of odd, regardless of which comes first in the list.\n\nWait, for example, list [2,4,3,5]. First even is 2, first odd is 3. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nAnother example: list [3,5,2,4]. First odd is 3, first even is 2. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nSo regardless of which comes first in the list, it's always (first_even) minus (first_odd).\n\nWait no, wait: the function is to find the difference between the first even and the first odd number. So if the first even is found before the first odd, then it's even minus odd. If the first odd is found before even, then it's still even minus odd? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no: the function should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number in the list, regardless of their order, and compute even - odd.\n\nSo for [3,5,2,4], first_odd is 3, first_even is 2. So difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nFor [2,4,3,5], first_even is 2, first_odd is 3: 2-3=-1.\n\nBut what if the list has no even or odd numbers? Well, perhaps we can assume that the input list contains at least one even and one odd number. Otherwise, the function might return null or some default value, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that both exist.\n\nNow, back to Midio nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and pass it to the output.\n\nBut how do I track first_odd and first_even across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables in the parent scope unless using some form of state management, which Midio might not support natively.\n\nWait, perhaps using a context object that's passed by reference. But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function. Each time the handler is called, it receives this context which holds first_odd and first_even. Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly. Alternatively, maybe using a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Map handler where each element is processed, and in the handler function, we track the first_odd and first_even by updating some external storage, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: find the index of the first odd and even numbers using List.GenerateRange or other nodes, then extract those elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop to iterate through each element, and for each, check if it's odd or even. Once both are found, compute the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio without state variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can use two separate For loops: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. First pass:\n   - Iterate through each item.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd and break the loop.\n\n2. Second pass:\n   - Iterate again.\n   - Check if it's even.\n   - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even and break.\n\n3. Compute difference: first_odd - first_even.\n\nBut how to implement breaking out of a loop early in Midio? Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration. So, if I can set a flag when the first_odd or first_even is found, and then in the predicate, check that flag to decide whether to continue.\n\nBut again, without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using",

So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndifference = first_even - first_odd\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1. Initialize first_odd and first_even as null at the start of the function.\n2. Iterate over each item using For loop.\n3. In each iteration:\n   a. Check if current item is odd or even.\n   b. If first_odd is null, set it to current item if odd.\n   c. Similarly for even.\n   d. After both are found, compute difference and assign to output.\n\nBut how do I handle the state between iterations? Since Midio's For loop handler runs each time with a new item, I can use instance properties in the module to store first_odd and first_even.\n\nSo inside the function module:\n\n- Declare properties for first_odd and first_even.\n- In the For loop handler:\n   - Check if current item is odd: n % 2 != 0\n   - If first_odd is null, set it.\n   - Similarly for even.\n   - After both are set, compute difference.\n\nBut how to trigger the computation once both are found. Because each iteration processes one item, and after processing an item, if both are",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and set the output.\n\nBut how to manage state between iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables unless using a context node that holds these states.\n\nWait, Midio allows for instance variables in modules. So perhaps within the function module, I can declare properties like first_odd and first_even, and update them as needed during each loop iteration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but actually, we take their values regardless of order. Wait no, because the list is processed in order, so first_even is the first occurrence of even, and first_odd is the first occurrence of odd, regardless of which comes first in the list.\n\nWait, for example, list [2,4,3,5]. First even is 2, first odd is 3. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nAnother example: list [3,5,2,4]. First odd is 3, first even is 2. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nSo regardless of which comes first in the list, it's always (first_even) minus (first_odd).\n\nWait no, wait: the function is to find the difference between the first even and the first odd number. So if the first even is found before the first odd, then it's even minus odd. If the first odd is found before even, then it's still even minus odd? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no: the function should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number in the list, regardless of their order, and compute even - odd.\n\nSo for [3,5,2,4], first_odd is 3, first_even is 2. So difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nFor [2,4,3,5], first_even is 2, first_odd is 3: 2-3=-1.\n\nBut what if the list has no even or odd numbers? Well, perhaps we can assume that the input list contains at least one even and one odd number. Otherwise, the function might return null or some default value, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that both exist.\n\nNow, back to Midio nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average.

So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes.

Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg.

The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes. For the sum, I'll write an expression that directly computes n*(n+1)/2 using 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as another input. But how do I get (n+1)? Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do.

Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function has an input string and needs to output the first character that appears more than once. The signature shows inputs for execute trigger and the string, and outputs for continue trigger and the char.\n\nI remember that Midio uses nodes for functions. So I'll probably need to process each character in the string, keep track of characters we've seen, and check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in a tracking structure (like a set or list).\n4. If it is, return this as the first repeated character.\n5. If not, add it to the tracking structure and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the Iteration.Map node to process each character. Maybe also use List.Contains to check if the character exists in a list that tracks seen characters.\n\nWait, but how do I maintain state between iterations? Since each iteration is processed separately, I might need to accumulate the seen characters as I go.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a variable or another function to keep track of the seen characters. But Midio doesn't support variables directly; instead, we can use properties in nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each character, add it to a list and then check if the next characters are present in that list.\n\nWait, but processing in order is important because I need the first occurrence where a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me outline the steps with Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by getting the string input.\n- Split the string into individual characters. The Strings.Characters node can do this, outputting a list of characters.\n- Then, iterate over each character in this list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each character, check if it exists in a list of seen characters.\n- If it does, set this as the result and stop further processing.\n- If not, add it to the seen characters list.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the seen characters across iterations? Since each map iteration is independent, maybe I need to use a function that accumulates the seen characters.\n\nWait, perhaps using a reduce approach. The Iteration.Reduce node can help accumulate the seen characters and check for duplicates as we go.\n\nAlternatively, in the map handler, for each character, check against all previous ones. But that might not be efficient, but for simplicity, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about using a list to track seen characters. For each character in the string:\n\n1. Check if it exists in the seen list.\n2. If yes, return it as the first repeated.\n3. If no, add it to the seen list and proceed.\n\nIn Midio, I can use List.Contains for step 1. So, for each character, pass it to a List.Contains node that checks against the seen list.\n\nBut how do I build the seen list incrementally? Maybe using a function that appends each new character.\n\nWait, perhaps in the map handler, for each element (character), we can have two outputs: one for the result if found, and another for updating the seen list. But Midio's nodes might not support this directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a nested structure where for each character, we check against all previous ones. But that could be inefficient, but perhaps acceptable for simplicity.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of the first duplicate found. Once found, stop processing further characters.\n\nSo, using Iteration.Map, for each character at index i:\n\n- Check if any character from 0 to i-1 equals current character.\n- If yes, return it as the result.\n\nThis can be done by comparing the substring up to i with the rest.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I get the substring? The Strings.Slice node can help. So for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character exists in that substring.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because we're processing each character one by one, so perhaps it's better to build a list of seen characters as we go.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Iteration.Map on this list, where each handler processes a character and checks if it's in the seen list.\n3. The map handler needs access to the seen list built so far.\n\nBut since each iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a shared variable. So perhaps instead, for each character, pass along the current state of the seen list.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether a duplicate was found and the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it's in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, set the result and stop processing.\n  - If no, add it to the accumulator.\n- The reduce node can then output the first duplicate found.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support stopping early; it processes all elements unless I find a way to short-circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the reduce handler, once a duplicate is found, we can set a flag and ignore further processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that in Midio? Maybe using a property to track whether we've found the result yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nUsing Iteration.Map:\n\n- For each character, check if it exists in any of the previous characters.\n- The first time this is true, return it as the result.\n\nBut how do I access all previous characters up to the current index? Maybe for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character is present.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing the index. Alternatively, perhaps using a variable to track the first duplicate found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a function that iterates through each character, keeping a list of seen characters, and returns as soon as a duplicate is found.\n\nBut in Midio, functions can't have variables; they process data as it comes in. So I need to find a way to maintain state across iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using the continue trigger to chain the processing. Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's in the seen list.\n  - If yes, set the result and break the loop.\n  - If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I maintain the seen list across iterations?

Maybe in the map handler, for each character, I can have two outputs: one for the result (if found) and another for the updated seen list.\n\nWait, perhaps using a custom function that does this.

So perhaps after checking, if found, set the result and stop processing further characters.\n\nWait, but how to stop processing once a duplicate is found? Maybe using a predicate in the for loop.\n\nAlternatively, process each character one by one, keeping track of seen characters, and as soon as a duplicate is found, output it and trigger continue.\n\nLet me try structuring this with nodes:\n\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Split into characters: use Strings.Characters.\n3. Iterate over these characters using Std.For.\n4. For each character, check if it's in the seen list (List.Contains).\n5. If yes, set the output char and trigger continue.\n6. If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how to maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe use a variable or another function that appends the new character each time.\n\nWait, perhaps using a List.GenerateRange starting from an empty list and appending each new character as we process them.\n\nAlternatively, for each iteration, pass the current index and the string, then check if any previous character is equal to the current one.\n\nBut that might involve more nodes. Let me outline:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of chars.\n- Use Iteration.Map on this list, processing each character with its index.\n- For each element (char and index), iterate from 0 to index-1 to check if any previous char is equal.\n- If found, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut that would require nested loops. Let me see how to structure this in Midio:\n\nIn the map handler:\n- Get the current character and its index.\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list from 0 to index-1.\n- For each of these indices, get the corresponding character from the original string.\n- Check if any of these characters match the current one.\n\nIf any match is found, set the result. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nThis approach would work but might be less efficient for long strings since it checks all previous characters each time.\n\nBut given Midio's node structure, this could be a feasible way without needing to",

Maybe use a variable or another function that appends the new character each time.\n\nWait, perhaps using a List.GenerateRange starting from an empty list and appending each new character as we process them.\n\nAlternatively, for each iteration, pass the current index and the string, then check if any previous character is equal to the current one.\n\nBut that might involve more nodes. Let me outline:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of chars.\n- Use Iteration.Map on this list, processing each character with its index.\n- For each element (char and index), iterate from 0 to index-1 to check if any previous char is equal.\n- If found, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut that would require nested loops.

Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's in the seen list.\n  - If yes, set the result and break the loop.\n  - If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe by using a function that appends to a list property.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't support modifying properties directly in this way. So perhaps each iteration can pass along the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a reduce approach where each step adds the character to the seen list and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me try structuring it with Reduce:\n\n- The initial accumulator is an empty list.\n- For each character:\n  - Check if it's in the accumulator.\n    - If yes, return",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function has an input string and needs to output the first character that appears more than once. The signature shows inputs for execute trigger and the string, and outputs for continue trigger and the char.\n\nI remember that Midio uses nodes for functions. So I'll probably need to process each character in the string, keep track of characters we've seen, and check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in a tracking structure (like a set or list).\n4. If it is, return this as the first repeated character.\n5. If not, add it to the tracking structure and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the Iteration.Map node to process each character. Maybe also use List.Contains to check if the character exists in a list that tracks seen characters.\n\nWait, but how do I maintain state between iterations? Since each iteration is processed separately, I might need to accumulate the seen characters as I go.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a variable or another function to keep track of the seen characters. But Midio doesn't support variables directly; instead, we can use properties in nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each character, add it to a list and then check if the next characters are present in that list.\n\nWait, but processing in order is important because I need the first occurrence where a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me outline the steps with Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by getting the string input.\n- Split the string into individual characters. The Strings.Characters node can do this, outputting a list of characters.\n- Then, iterate over each character in this list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each character, check if it exists in a list of seen characters.\n- If it does, set this as the result and stop further processing.\n- If not, add it to the seen characters list.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the seen characters across iterations? Since each map iteration is independent, maybe I need to use a function that accumulates the seen characters.\n\nWait, perhaps using a reduce approach. The Iteration.Reduce node can help accumulate the seen characters and check for duplicates as we go.\n\nAlternatively, in the map handler, for each character, check against all previous ones. But that might not be efficient, but for simplicity, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about using a list to track seen characters. For each character in the string:\n\n1. Check if it exists in the seen list.\n2. If yes, return it as the first repeated.\n3. If no, add it to the seen list and proceed.\n\nIn Midio, I can use List.Contains for step 1. So, for each character, pass it to a List.Contains node that checks against the seen list.\n\nBut how do I build the seen list incrementally? Maybe using a function that appends each new character.\n\nWait, perhaps in the map handler, for each element (character), we can have two outputs: one for the result if found, and another for updating the seen list. But Midio's nodes might not support this directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a separate process where after checking, if not found, add to the seen list.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable node to keep track of the seen characters. But I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Alternatively, use a List.GenerateRange or similar to build the list as we go.\n\nAnother approach: For each character at position i, check all previous positions (0 to i-1) for duplicates. If found, return it. This would involve nested loops but might be manageable with map and filter nodes.\n\nBut that could get complicated. Maybe a better way is to iterate through the string, keep a list of seen characters, and as soon as a duplicate is found, output it.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of chars.\n- Use Iteration.Map on this list, processing each character.\n- For each character, check if it's in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If yes, set the result and trigger continue.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how to maintain the seen list across iterations? Since each map iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a variable. So perhaps I need to pass the seen list as an input to each map iteration.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether it's found and the updated seen list.\n\nBut Midio functions can have multiple inputs and outputs. Maybe in the map handler, for each character, I can have two outputs: one for the result (if found) and another for the updated seen list.\n\nWait, perhaps using a custom function that does this. But since we're limited to standard nodes, maybe it's better to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it exists in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, return this character immediately.\n  - If no, append it to the accumulator and continue.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support early termination. So perhaps after checking, if found, set the result and stop processing further characters.\n\nWait, but how to stop processing once a duplicate is found? Maybe using a predicate in the for loop.\n\nAlternatively, process each character one by one, keeping track of seen characters, and as soon as a duplicate is found, output it and trigger continue.\n\nLet me try structuring this with nodes:\n\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Split into characters: use Strings.Characters.\n3. Iterate over these characters using Std.For.\n4. For each character, check if it's in the seen list (List.Contains).\n5. If yes, set the output char and trigger continue.\n6. If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how to maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe use a variable or another function that appends the new character each time.\n\nWait, perhaps using a List.GenerateRange starting from an empty list and appending each new character as we process them.\n\nAlternatively, for each iteration, pass the current index and the string, then check if any previous character is equal to the current one.\n\nBut that might involve more nodes. Let me outline:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of chars.\n- Use Iteration.Map on this list, processing each character with its index.\n- For each element (char and index), iterate from 0 to index-1 to check if any previous char is equal.\n- If found, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut that would require nested loops. Let me see how to structure this in Midio:\n\nIn the map handler:\n- Get the current character and its index.\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list from 0 to index-1.\n- For each of these indices, get the corresponding character from the original string.\n- Check if any of these characters match the current one.\n\nIf any match is found, set the result. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nThis approach would work but might be less efficient for long strings since it checks all previous characters each time.\n\nBut given Midio's node structure, this could be a feasible way without needing to",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called second_smallest that finds the second smallest number in a list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The task is to take a list of numbers and return the second smallest one. If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order. Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest. But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list.

Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct.

The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements.

However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list.

Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest. But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list.

Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1.

Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Compare each element with the target.\n- When an element matches, store its index.\n- After the loop, return the stored index if any match was found.\n\nI'll need to set up the For loop to iterate over the list. The 'item' output will give me each element, and I can compare it using Logic.Equal or a Math.Expression.\n\nWait, but in Midio, comparing objects might require a deep scan, which could be an issue if elements are complex. But since we're dealing with numbers, maybe it's okay.\n\nI'll set up the For loop to iterate over the list. Each item is checked against the target element. If they are equal, I'll record the index.\n\nBut how do I track the index? The For loop provides the index as an output property. So I can use that.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the inputs are 'list', 'elem', and 'execute'. The outputs are 'index' and 'continue'.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n- Connect the list to the For loop's items.\n- Use a variable to track whether the element has been found.\n- For each item, check if it equals elem. If yes, set the index output.\n- After processing all items, if found, return true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in Midio, I can't directly store variables unless using some stateful nodes, which I don't think are available here. So perhaps I need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a sorted array, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut without state, maybe the simplest way is to iterate from the end and return the first match.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have reverse iteration directly. So perhaps using a For loop with index and checking each element in reverse order isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate a range from 0 to length-1 and then iterate in reverse order.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to use a linear search from the end.\n\nWait, but how do I get the elements in reverse order? The For loop gives items in their natural order. So perhaps I need to reverse the list first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find all indices where the element occurs and then take the maximum index.\n\nBut that would require collecting all matches, which might not be efficient, but given Midio's constraints, it could work.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over each element with its index.\n2. For each element, check if it equals the target.\n3. If it does, collect the index.\n4. After processing all elements, find the maximum index where the condition was true.\n5. Return that index.\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio nodes?\n\nI can use a Map handler to process each element and its index. For each element, if it equals elem, store the index.\n\nWait, but storing variables isn't straightforward. So perhaps I can collect all indices where the condition is true into a list, then find the maximum of that list.\n\nSo:\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indexes from 0 to length-1.\n- Map each index to check if the corresponding element equals elem.\n- Collect the indexes where this is true.\n- If the collected list is not empty, return its last element (or max), else return null or false.\n\nBut how do I get the corresponding element for each index? Because in Midio, you can't directly access an element by index unless you have a function to do so.\n\nWait, perhaps using List.GetItemAtIndex. But looking at the available nodes, there's no such node. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop with index and item, but I'm not sure how to get both.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: iterate through each element, keep track of whether it's equal to elem, and if so, store the current index as the last one.\n\nBut without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable in the function scope. But Midio functions are stateless unless you use some external storage, which isn't available here.\n\nSo maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut again, without state, it's hard to track.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop and for each item, if it equals elem, set the index output. But how do I ensure that after all items are processed, the last occurrence is captured?\n\nBecause as soon as an item matches, the index is set, but subsequent matches will overwrite it. So by the end of the loop, the index should be the last one.\n\nWait, no. Because in a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and if I set the index output each time, the last one would indeed be the last occurrence.\n\nSo here's how:\n\n- Connect the list to For.items.\n- In the handler, for each item, check if it equals elem.\n- If yes, set the index output to the current index (from For.index).\n- After all items are processed, return whether any were found.\n\nBut in Midio, I can't directly access the index within the handler unless the For loop provides it. Looking back at the function signature, the For loop's 'index' is an output property, so perhaps I can connect that to a variable.\n\nWait, but in the code, how do I capture the index for each item? Maybe using a Math.Add node to track the current index.\n\nAlternatively, use the For.index directly. So in the handler, for each item, if it equals elem, set the output index to For.index.\n\nBut then, after all items are processed, the last occurrence would be the correct one.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use a For loop connected to the list.\n- In the handler",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence.

So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this.

Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow.

But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4.

Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations easily. Maybe using a different approach with For loop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list in two passes: first find the first odd, then find the first even after that point, or somewhere else in the list.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, during iteration, for each item, check if it's odd and if we haven't found an odd yet\u2014store it. Similarly, check if it's even and store the first one encountered.\n\nWait, but I need to find the first odd and then the first even after that. Or is it just the first occurrence of each regardless of order? The problem says \"the first even and first odd number,\" which implies their positions in the list. So, for example, if the list is [2, 3, 4], the first even is 2, first odd is 3; difference is -1.\n\nSo, I need to find the first occurrence of an odd and the first occurrence of an even, regardless of which comes first in the list. Then subtract them: even - odd.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd.\" So if even comes before odd, it's even minus odd; else, odd minus even? Or is it always even minus odd?\n\nLooking back at the task description: \"the difference of the first even and first odd number.\" The wording suggests (even) - (odd). But I should confirm.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the function will compute evenNumber - oddNumber.\n\nSo, during iteration, for each item:\n\n- If it's the first odd encountered, store it.\n- If it's the first even encountered after that, or if an even comes before any odd, store it as well.\n\nWait, but I need to find both the first even and the first odd in the entire list. So, perhaps during iteration, for each item:\n\n1. Check if it's odd. If yes and we haven't found an odd yet, mark it as the first odd.\n2. Check if it's even. If yes and we haven't found an even yet, mark it as the first even.\n\nOnce both are found, stop processing further items because we only need the first occurrences.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio? Since each iteration is handled by a handler function, which can't maintain state between iterations unless using some external storage or context.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a context object that's passed through each iteration. The handler can modify this context to keep track of whether it has found the first odd and even numbers.\n\nSo, in the Map node's handler, I'll have access to the current item and can update the context accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize a context with flags for whether we've found an odd or even.\n- Iterate through each item in the list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's odd (n % 2 != 0) using Math.Expression.\n   - If it's odd and context.oddFound is false, set context.oddValue to this number and mark oddFound as true.\n   - Similarly, check if it's even (n % 2 == 0). If yes and context.evenFound is false, set context.evenValue and mark evenFound as true.\n   - Once both are found, perhaps break out of the loop early? But Midio doesn't support breaking loops easily. So maybe continue processing until all items are checked.\n\nAfter processing all items, if either odd or even isn't found, handle that case (but assuming they exist per problem statement), then compute the difference as context.evenValue - context.oddValue and return it.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each handler is a separate function, so I can't directly modify variables outside of it. So perhaps using a root context or some other way to pass state between iterations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using two separate passes: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even after that point.\n\nBut that might be more complex. Alternatively, use a For loop with index and iterate through each element, checking for both conditions as we go.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop:\n\n- Use Std.For to iterate over the list.\n- For each item, check if it's odd or even.\n- Keep track of firstOdd and firstEven in variables outside the loop.\n\nBut again, Midio doesn't support local variables in functions easily. So perhaps using a context object that holds these values.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it like this:\n\n1. Use a For loop to iterate through each element in the list.\n2. For each item, check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression nodes.\n3. If it's the first odd encountered, store its value and mark it as found.\n4. Similarly for even.\n5. Once both are found, calculate the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes needed:\n\n- For loop: Std.For\n- Check if a number is odd or even: Math.Expression (n % 2)\n- Logic to check if we've found an odd or even yet: perhaps using variables in the context.\n\nWait, but each iteration of For would have its own handler. So I need a way to carry state between iterations. Maybe using a root context that holds the firstOdd and firstEven values.\n\nSo, in the For loop's",

Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a.

After setting both, calculate the difference and pass it to the output.\n\nBut how do I track first_odd and first_even across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables in the parent scope unless using some form of state management, which Midio might not support natively.\n\nWait, perhaps using a context object that's passed by reference. But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go.

Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables unless using a context node that holds these states.\n\nWait, Midio allows for instance variables in modules. So perhaps within the function module, I can declare properties like first_odd and first_even, and update them as needed during each loop iteration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but in our case, we're taking the first occurrence of each regardless of order. Wait no: for example, list is [3,4], first odd is 3, first even is 4; difference is 1 (4-3). If list is [4,3], same result.\n\nBut wait, what if the first even comes before the first odd? Like list [2,3]. Then first_even is 2, first_odd is 3. Difference is 2 -3 = -1. But perhaps the problem expects absolute difference? Or maybe it's just subtraction regardless of order.\n\nThe task says \"difference\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndifference = first_even - first_odd\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1. Initialize first_odd and first_even as null at the start of the function.\n2. Iterate over each item using For loop.\n3. In each iteration:\n   a. Check if current item is odd or even.\n   b. If first_odd is null, set it to current item if odd.\n   c. Similarly for even.\n   d. After both are found, compute difference and assign to output.\n\nBut how do I handle the state between iterations? Since Midio's For loop handler runs each time with a new item, I can use instance properties in the module to store first_odd and first_even.\n\nSo inside the function module:\n\n- Declare properties for first_odd and first_even.\n- In the For loop handler:\n   - Check if current item is odd: n % 2 != 0\n   - If first_odd is null, set it.\n   - Similarly for even.\n   - After both are set, compute difference.\n\nBut how to trigger the computation once both are found.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and pass it to the output.\n\nBut how do I track first_odd and first_even across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables in the parent scope unless using some form of state management, which Midio might not support natively.\n\nWait, perhaps using a context object that's passed by reference. But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function. Each time the handler is called, it receives this context which holds first_odd and first_even. Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly. Alternatively, maybe using a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Map handler where each element is processed, and in the handler function, we track the first_odd and first_even by updating some external storage, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: find the index of the first odd and even numbers using List.GenerateRange or other nodes, then extract those elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop to iterate through each element, and for each, check if it's odd or even. Once both are found, compute the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio without state variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can use two separate For loops: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. First pass:\n   - Iterate through each item.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd and break the loop.\n\n2. Second pass:\n   - Iterate again.\n   - Check if it's even.\n   - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even and break.\n\n3.

So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but in our case, we're taking the first occurrence of each regardless of order. Wait no: for example, list is [3,4], first odd is 3, first even is 4; difference is 1 (4-3). If list is [4,3], same result.\n\nBut wait, what if the first even comes before the first odd? Like list [2,3]. Then first_even is 2, first_odd is 3. Difference is 2 -3 = -1. But perhaps the problem expects absolute difference? Or maybe it's just subtraction regardless of order.\n\nThe task says \"difference\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndifference = first_even - first_odd\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes. For the sum, I'll write an expression that directly computes n*(n+1)/2 using 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as another input. But how do I get (n+1)? Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",

For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes. For the sum, I'll write an expression that directly computes n*(n+1)/2 using 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as another input. But how do I get (n+1)? Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach.

Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes.

So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about"

But that could be inefficient, but perhaps acceptable for simplicity.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of the first duplicate found. Once found, stop processing further characters.\n\nSo, using Iteration.Map, for each character at index i:\n\n- Check if any character from 0 to i-1 equals current character.\n- If yes, return it as the result.\n\nThis can be done by comparing the substring up to i with the rest.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I get the substring?

So perhaps instead, for each character, pass along the current state of the seen list.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether a duplicate was found and the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it's in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, set the result and stop processing.\n  - If no, add it to the accumulator.\n- The reduce node can then output the first duplicate found.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support stopping early; it processes all elements unless I find a way to short-circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the reduce handler, once a duplicate is found, we can set a flag and ignore further processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that in Midio? Maybe using a property to track whether we've found the result yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nUsing Iteration.Map:\n\n- For each character, check if it exists in any of the previous characters.\n- The first time this is true, return it as the result.\n\nBut how do I access all previous characters up to the current index? Maybe for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character is present.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing the index. Alternatively, perhaps using a variable to track the first duplicate found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a function that iterates through each character, keeping a list of seen characters, and returns as soon as a duplicate is found.\n\nBut in Midio, functions can't have variables; they process data as it comes in. So I need to find a way to maintain state across iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using the continue trigger to chain the processing. Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called second_smallest that finds the second smallest number in a list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The task is to take a list of numbers and return the second smallest one. If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order. Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest. But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list. Then, get the length of sorted_list using List.Length. If the length is less than 2, maybe set output to null. Otherwise, take the element at index 1.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. Get the element at index 1 of the sorted list.\n3.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called second_smallest that finds the second smallest number in a list.

If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order. Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest.

If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list.

Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The task is to take a list of numbers and return the second smallest one. If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order. Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest. But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list. Then, get the length of sorted_list using List.Length. If the length is less than 2, maybe set output to null. Otherwise, take the element at index 1.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. Get the element at index 1 of the sorted list.\n3. Return this as the output.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio's nodes.\n\nLooking at the function signature, I need to create a function with an input list and execute trigger, and outputs continue and output.\n\nI can use List.Sort on the input list. Then, perhaps use List.GetAt to get index 1.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check before accessing index 1.\n\nAlternatively, proceed without checking, as per the problem's assumption that the list is valid.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Create an instance of List.Sort, connect it to the input list.\n- Then, create an instance of List.GetAt with index 1 connected to the sorted list.\n- The result goes to the output property.\n\nBut I need to structure this within the function's nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute the second smallest without additional steps. For example, after sorting, take the element at position 2 (since indexing starts at 0). So index 1 is the second element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use an expression that computes min of the list, then finds the next min in the filtered list.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to sort and pick the second element.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Use List.Sort on the input list.\n- Then, get the length of the sorted list. If length >=2, take index 1; else, return null or handle accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I conditionally set the output based on the length?\n\nI can use a Std.If node to check if the length is less than 2. If so, set output to null; else, get the second element.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Sort the list.\n2. Get its length.\n3. Use Math.LessThan to compare length < 2.\n4. If true, output is null.\n5. Else, get index 1 of sorted list and output it.\n\nThis way, we handle cases where the list has fewer than two elements.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio's node flow.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- List.Sort instance connected to input list.\n- List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Math.LessThan to check if length < 2.\n- Std.If to choose between null and index 1.\n\nThen, connect the If's value to the output.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ninstance(x: ...) sort_list root.Std_k98ojb.List.Sort {}\ninput_list -> sort_list.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) sorted_length root.Std_k98ojb.List.Length {}\nsort_list.result -> sorted_length.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) less_than root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\nsorted_length.result -> less_than.left\n2 -> less_than.right\n\ninstance(x: ...) if_node root.Std_k98ojb.Std.If {}\nless_than.result -> if_node.predicate\n\nThen, for the true"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Compare each element with the target.\n- When an element matches, store its index.\n- After the loop, return the stored index if any match was found.\n\nI'll need to set up the For loop to iterate over the list. The 'item' output will give me each element, and I can compare it using Logic.Equal or a Math.Expression.\n\nWait, but in Midio, comparing objects might require a deep scan, which could be an issue if elements are complex. But since we're dealing with numbers, maybe it's okay.\n\nI'll set up the For loop to iterate over the list. Each item is checked against the target element. If they are equal, I'll record the index.\n\nBut how do I track the index? The For loop provides the index as an output property. So I can use that.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the inputs are 'list', 'elem', and 'execute'. The outputs are 'index' and 'continue'.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n- Connect the list to the For loop's items.\n- Use a variable to track whether the element has been found.\n- For each item, check if it equals elem. If yes, set the index output.\n- After processing all items, if found, return true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in Midio, I can't directly store variables unless using some stateful nodes, which I don't think are available here. So perhaps I need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a sorted array, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut without state, maybe the simplest way is to iterate from the end and return the first match.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have reverse iteration directly. So perhaps using a For loop with index and checking each element in reverse order isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate a range from 0 to length-1 and then iterate in reverse order.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to use a linear search from the end.\n\nWait, but how do I get the elements in reverse order? The For loop gives items in their natural order. So perhaps I need to reverse the list first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find all indices where the element occurs and then take the maximum index.\n\nBut that would require collecting all matches, which might not be efficient, but given Midio's constraints, it could work.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over each element with its index.\n2. For each element, check if it equals the target.\n3. If it does, collect the index.\n4. After processing all elements, find the maximum index where the condition was true.\n5. Return that index.\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio nodes?\n\nI can use a Map handler to process each element and its index. For each element, if it equals elem, store the index.\n\nWait, but storing variables isn't straightforward. So perhaps I can collect all indices where the condition is true into a list, then find the maximum of that list.\n\nSo:\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indexes from 0 to length-1.\n- Map each index to check if the corresponding element equals elem.\n- Collect the indexes where this is true.\n- If the collected list is not empty, return its last element (or max), else return null or false.\n\nBut how do I get the corresponding element for each index? Because in Midio, you can't directly access an element by index unless you have a function to do so.\n\nWait, perhaps using List.GetItemAtIndex. But looking at the available nodes, there's no such node. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop with index and item, but I'm not sure how to get both.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: iterate through each element, keep track of whether it's equal to elem, and if so, store the current index as the last one.\n\nBut without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable in the function scope. But Midio functions are stateless unless you use some external storage, which isn't available here.\n\nSo maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut again, without state, it's hard to track.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop and for each item, if it equals elem, set the index output. But how do I ensure that after all items are processed, the last occurrence is captured?\n\nBecause as soon as an item matches, the index is set, but subsequent matches will overwrite it. So by the end of the loop, the index should be the last one.\n\nWait, no. Because in a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and if I set the index output each time, the last one would indeed be the last occurrence.\n\nSo here's how:\n\n- Connect the list to For.items.\n- In the handler, for each item, check if it equals elem.\n- If yes, set the index output to the current index (from For.index).\n- After all items are processed, return whether any were found.\n\nBut in Midio, I can't directly access the index within the handler unless the For loop provides it. Looking back at the function signature, the For loop's 'index' is an output property, so perhaps I can connect that to a variable.\n\nWait, but in the code, how do I capture the index for each item? Maybe using a Math.Add node to track the current index.\n\nAlternatively, use the For.index directly. So in the handler, for each item, if it equals elem, set the output index to For.index.\n\nBut then, after all items are processed, the last occurrence would be the correct one.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use a For loop connected to the list.\n- In the handler",

Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",

Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4.

Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations easily. Maybe using a different approach with For loop?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list in two passes: first find the first odd, then find the first even after that point, or somewhere else in the list.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, during iteration, for each item, check if it's odd and if we haven't found an odd yet\u2014store it. Similarly, check if it's even and store the first one encountered.\n\nWait, but I need to find the first odd and then the first even after that. Or is it just the first occurrence of each regardless of order? The problem says \"the first even and first odd number,\" which implies their positions in the list. So, for example, if the list is [2, 3, 4], the first even is 2, first odd is 3; difference is -1.\n\nSo, I need to find the first occurrence of an odd and the first occurrence of an even, regardless of which comes first in the list. Then subtract them: even - odd.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd.\" So if even comes before odd, it's even minus odd; else, odd minus even? Or is it always even minus odd?\n\nLooking back at the task description: \"the difference of the first even and first odd number.\" The wording suggests (even) - (odd). But I should confirm.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the function will compute evenNumber - oddNumber.\n\nSo, during iteration, for each item:\n\n- If it's the first odd encountered, store it.\n- If it's the first even encountered after that, or if an even comes before any odd, store it as well.\n\nWait, but I need to find both the first even and the first odd in the entire list. So, perhaps during iteration, for each item:\n\n1. Check if it's odd. If yes and we haven't found an odd yet, mark it as the first odd.\n2. Check if it's even. If yes and we haven't found an even yet, mark it as the first even.\n\nOnce both are found, stop processing further items because we only need the first occurrences.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio? Since each iteration is handled by a handler function, which can't maintain state between iterations unless using some external storage or context.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a context object that's passed through each iteration. The handler can modify this context to keep track of whether it has found the first odd and even numbers.\n\nSo, in the Map node's handler, I'll have access to the current item and can update the context accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize a context with flags for whether we've found an odd or even.\n- Iterate through each item in the list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's odd (n % 2 != 0) using Math.Expression.\n   - If it's odd and context.oddFound is false, set context.oddValue to this number and mark oddFound as true.\n   - Similarly, check if it's even (n % 2 == 0). If yes and context.evenFound is false, set context.evenValue and mark evenFound as true.\n   - Once both are found, perhaps break out of the loop early? But Midio doesn't support breaking loops easily. So maybe continue processing until all items are checked.\n\nAfter processing all items, if either odd or even isn't found, handle that case (but assuming they exist per problem statement), then compute the difference as context.evenValue - context.oddValue and return it.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each handler is a separate function, so I can't directly modify variables outside of it. So perhaps using a root context or some other way to pass state between iterations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using two separate passes: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even after that point.\n\nBut that might be more complex. Alternatively, use a For loop with index and iterate through each element, checking for both conditions as we go.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop:\n\n- Use Std.For to iterate over the list.\n- For each item, check if it's odd or even.\n- Keep track of firstOdd and firstEven in variables outside the loop.\n\nBut again, Midio doesn't support local variables in functions easily. So perhaps using a context object that holds these values.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it like this:\n\n1. Use a For loop to iterate through each element in the list.\n2. For each item, check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression nodes.\n3. If it's the first odd encountered, store its value and mark it as found.\n4. Similarly for even.\n5. Once both are found, calculate the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes needed:\n\n- For loop: Std.For\n- Check if a number is odd or even: Math.Expression (n % 2)\n- Logic to check if we've found an odd or even yet: perhaps using variables in the context.\n\nWait, but each iteration of For would have its own handler. So I need a way to carry state between iterations. Maybe using a root context that holds the firstOdd and firstEven values.\n\nSo, in the For loop's",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. The input is a list of numbers, and the output is a single number which is the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list.\n\nSo, step by step, here's what I need to do:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Identify the first odd number encountered.\n3. Identify the first even number encountered after finding the odd one or somewhere in the list.\n4. Calculate the difference between these two numbers.\n5. Return this difference as the output.\n\nWait, but what if there are no odd or even numbers? Hmm, maybe the function should handle that, but since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll assume the list has at least one odd and one even number.\n\nNow, thinking about Midio nodes. I'll probably need to use iteration to go through each item in the list. The Iteration.Map node could be useful here because it allows me to process each element with a handler function.\n\nIn the handler function for Map, I can check if an item is odd or even. Let's see:\n\n- For each item, check if it's odd using Math.LessThanOrEqual with 0 (since Modulo by 2 would be 1 for odd and 0 for even). Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and pass it to the output.\n\nBut how do I track first_odd and first_even across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables in the parent scope unless using some form of state management, which Midio might not support natively.\n\nWait, perhaps using a context object that's passed by reference. But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function. Each time the handler is called, it receives this context which holds first_odd and first_even. Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly. Alternatively, maybe using a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Map handler where each element is processed, and in the handler function, we track the first_odd and first_even by updating some external storage, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: find the index of the first odd and even numbers using List.GenerateRange or other nodes, then extract those elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop to iterate through each element, and for each, check if it's odd or even. Once both are found, compute the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio without state variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can use two separate For loops: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. First pass:\n   - Iterate through each item.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd and break the loop.\n\n2. Second pass:\n   - Iterate again.\n   - Check if it's even.\n   - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even and break.\n\n3. Compute difference: first_odd - first_even.\n\nBut how to implement breaking out of a loop early in Midio? Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration. So, if I can set a flag when the first_odd or first_even is found, and then in the predicate, check that flag to decide whether to continue.\n\nBut again, without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using",

Wait, actually, if a number mod 2 equals 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.\n\nSo, I can use the Math.Expression node to compute n % 2. If the result is 0, it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nI'll need two variables: one to store the first odd number and another for the first even. Once both are found, calculate their difference.\n\nBut how do I track these in Midio? Since each handler call is separate, I can't use local variables directly. So, perhaps using a context object that holds the state\u2014like whether we've found an odd or even yet, and their values.\n\nWait, but Midio's Iteration.Map doesn't support maintaining state across iterations natively. Hmm, maybe I should switch to using a loop with Std.For, which allows more control over iteration steps.\n\nYes, using Std.For makes sense here. The For node can iterate over each item in the list. Inside the loop, I can check each number and track the first odd and even.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n- Use List.Contains to check if the list is empty? Or proceed assuming it's not.\n- Initialize variables for first_odd and first_even as null or undefined.\n- For each item in the list:\n  - If first_odd hasn't been found yet, check if current item is odd. If yes, set first_odd.\n  - Similarly, if first_even isn't found, check if current item is even. If yes, set first_even.\n  - Once both are found, break out of the loop as we don't need to process further items.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I break out of a loop early? For loops typically continue until all items are processed unless there's a condition to stop. Maybe after finding both, set a flag and then in the handler, check if processing should continue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to process each item, updating first_odd and first_even as needed, and once both are found, calculate the difference immediately.\n\nBut how do I structure this with Midio nodes? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and set the output.\n\nBut how to manage state between iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables unless using a context node that holds these states.\n\nWait, Midio allows for instance variables in modules. So perhaps within the function module, I can declare properties like first_odd and first_even, and update them as needed during each loop iteration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So inside the handler of For, after checking if the current item is odd or even, I can set these properties.\n\nOnce both are found, I can compute the difference and assign it to the output property.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on the input list.\n- In the handler, for each item:\n   - Check if it's odd using Math.Expression: n % 2 != 0.\n   - If first_odd is not set yet, set it to current item.\n   - Similarly, check if even and set first_even if not set.\n   - After both are found, compute difference (first_odd - first_even) and assign to output.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which could be interpreted as even minus odd or vice versa. Looking back at the task: it's the difference between first even and first odd. So if even is 4 and odd is 3, difference is 1 (4-3). But in code, I need to make sure whether it's even - odd or odd - even.\n\nWait, the problem says \"difference of the first even and first odd\", which typically means even minus odd. So if even comes before odd, but actually, we take their values regardless of order. Wait no, because the list is processed in order, so first_even is the first occurrence of even, and first_odd is the first occurrence of odd, regardless of which comes first in the list.\n\nWait, for example, list [2,4,3,5]. First even is 2, first odd is 3. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nAnother example: list [3,5,2,4]. First odd is 3, first even is 2. Difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nSo regardless of which comes first in the list, it's always (first_even) minus (first_odd).\n\nWait no, wait: the function is to find the difference between the first even and the first odd number. So if the first even is found before the first odd, then it's even minus odd. If the first odd is found before even, then it's still even minus odd? Or is it the other way around?\n\nWait, no: the function should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number in the list, regardless of their order, and compute even - odd.\n\nSo for [3,5,2,4], first_odd is 3, first_even is 2. So difference is 2-3 = -1.\n\nFor [2,4,3,5], first_even is 2, first_odd is 3: 2-3=-1.\n\nBut what if the list has no even or odd numbers? Well, perhaps we can assume that the input list contains at least one even and one odd number. Otherwise, the function might return null or some default value, but since the problem doesn't specify, I'll proceed under the assumption that both exist.\n\nNow, back to Midio nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop (Std.For) on",

But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function. Each time the handler is called, it receives this context which holds first_odd and first_even. Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly. Alternatively, maybe using a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Map handler where each element is processed, and in the handler function, we track the first_odd and first_even by updating some external storage, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: find the index of the first odd and even numbers using List.GenerateRange or other nodes, then extract those elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop to iterate through each element, and for each, check if it's odd or even. Once both are found, compute the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio without state variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can use two separate For loops: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. First pass:\n   - Iterate through each item.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd and break the loop.\n\n2. Second pass:\n   - Iterate again.\n   - Check if it's even.\n   - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even and break.\n\n3. Compute difference: first_odd - first_even.\n\nBut how to implement breaking out of a loop early in Midio? Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration. So, if I can set a flag when the first_odd or first_even is found, and then in the predicate, check that flag to decide whether to continue.\n\nBut again, without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using",

Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Start by resetting variables when the function is called.\n2. Use a For loop over the list items.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Check if it's odd or even using Math.Expression (n % 2).\n   b. If first_odd is null and current is odd, set first_odd.\n   c. If first_even is null and current is even, set first_even.\n   d. After setting both, calculate the difference and pass it to the output.\n\nBut how do I track first_odd and first_even across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate handler call, I can't directly modify variables in the parent scope unless using some form of state management, which Midio might not support natively.\n\nWait, perhaps using a context object that's passed by reference. But Midio doesn't support mutable state easily. Alternatively, maybe use a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the first odd and even in separate passes through the list. First, iterate to find the first odd, then iterate again to find the first even, then compute the difference.\n\nThat might be simpler. Let's consider that approach:\n\n- Use For loop on the list to find the first odd number.\n- Once found, store it.\n- Then, use another For loop on the same list to find the first even number.\n- Compute their difference and output.\n\nBut this would require two passes over the list. Is that efficient? Maybe not, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, in a single pass, track both as I go. Let's try that.\n\nSo, inside the For loop handler:\n\n- Check if current item is odd. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- Check if current item is even. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, compute difference and pass to output.\n\nBut again, the challenge is maintaining state across iterations without using variables that can be modified in place.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a context object that's passed into the handler function. Each time the handler is called, it receives this context which holds first_odd and first_even. Then, after processing each item, update the context accordingly.\n\nBut Midio might not support passing state like that directly. Alternatively, maybe using a root node to hold these variables as properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a Map handler where each element is processed, and in the handler function, we track the first_odd and first_even by updating some external storage, but this seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: find the index of the first odd and even numbers using List.GenerateRange or other nodes, then extract those elements.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop to iterate through each element, and for each, check if it's odd or even. Once both are found, compute the difference.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio without state variables?\n\nWait, perhaps I can use two separate For loops: one to find the first odd, another to find the first even.\n\nLet me outline:\n\n1. First pass:\n   - Iterate through each item.\n   - Check if it's odd.\n   - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd and break the loop.\n\n2. Second pass:\n   - Iterate again.\n   - Check if it's even.\n   - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even and break.\n\n3. Compute difference: first_odd - first_even.\n\nBut how to implement breaking out of a loop early in Midio? Because once found, we don't need to process further items.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the predicate of the For loop to stop processing after finding the required element.\n\nWait, the For loop's predicate is checked before each iteration. So, if I can set a flag when the first_odd or first_even is found, and then in the predicate, check that flag to decide whether to continue.\n\nBut again, without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average.

Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1).

Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression.

But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n. But I need to make sure that if n is zero, I don't cause a division error, but since n represents natural numbers, it should be at least 1, so maybe I don't need to handle that case here.\n\nNow, looking at the provided external functions, I can use Math.Expression to evaluate mathematical expressions. This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes. For the sum, I'll write an expression that directly computes n*(n+1)/2 using 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as another input. But how do I get (n+1)? Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg.

This function allows me to create an expression using inputs, which is perfect for calculating sum and average without writing loops.\n\nI'll start by setting up the Math.Expression nodes. The first one will compute the sum using the formula n*(n+1)/2. The second will compute the average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nI need to connect these expressions properly. I'll have an input 'n' which is a Number property. Then, for each expression node, I'll set up the necessary inputs. For the sum, both operands are based on 'n', so I'll use 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as gen_1. Wait, no, actually, in Math.Expression, each operand is a separate input. So for n*(n+1), I need to create two expressions: one for n and another for n+1.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down. First, compute n+1 using an Add function. Then multiply that by n, and then divide by 2. Alternatively, since Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node, perhaps I can write the entire sum formula directly in one expression.\n\nYes, for the sum, I can create an expression like \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". That way, it's all handled in one step. Similarly, for the average, it's just \"sum / n\".\n\nSo I'll set up two Math.Expression instances: one for the sum and another for the average. The sum will take 'n' as gen_0, and (n+1) can be computed within the expression itself by using a separate Add node or perhaps directly in the expression string.\n\nWait, no, in the expression, I can reference inputs. So if I have an input named 'n', I can use it in the expression. For example, for sum, the expression would be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". But to compute n+1, I might need another Math.Add node.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute n+1 using a separate Add function and then pass that into the multiplication. Let me think about how to structure this.\n\nI'll create an instance of Math.Add to add 1 to 'n'. Then, use that result in the Math.Mul node along with 'n' to get n*(n+1). Then, divide by 2 using another Math.Div node. But wait, Midio might not have a Div function explicitly; perhaps I can use Math.Expression for division as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to compute everything within two Math.Expression nodes. For the sum, I'll write an expression that directly computes n*(n+1)/2 using 'n' as gen_0 and (n+1) as another input. But how do I get (n+1)? Maybe I can create a separate Add node where 1 is added to 'n', then use that in the sum expression.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Create an input property for 'n' of type Number.\n2. Create an output property for 'output' of type Any, which will hold both sum and average.\n3. Use a Math.Add node to compute n + 1. Let's call this add_0.\n4. Use a Math.Mul node to multiply 'n' by the result of add_0. Call this mul_0.\n5. Use another Math.Div node to divide the result of mul_0 by 2. Call this div_0. This gives the sum.\n6. Then, compute the average by dividing the sum (div_0.result) by 'n' using another Math.Div node, say avg_div.\n7. Finally, combine the sum and average into a structure, perhaps an object or a tuple, and assign it to the output.\n\nWait, but Midio's Math.Expression can handle more complex expressions in a single node. So maybe I don't need separate nodes for Add and Multiply. Instead, I can write the entire expression as a string in one Math.Expression instance.\n\nFor example, for sum:\n\nexpression_sum: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\"\n\nAnd for average:\n\nexpression_avg: \"sum / n\"\n\nBut to do this, I need to first compute 'sum' using an expression node and then use that result in the next expression. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a single output that contains both sum and average.\n\nWait, but the output is of type Any, which might be an object with properties for sum and avg. So I'll need to structure it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute both sum and average in two separate Math.Expression nodes and then combine them into an object.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n- Create input 'n' as a Number.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\". Let's call this sum_expression.\n- Compute average by taking sum divided by n: \"sum / n\". But since I can't reference variables directly, perhaps I need to compute it in another expression node.\n\nWait, no. In Midio, each Math.Expression node can only use the inputs provided. So for the average, I can write an expression that references 'n' and the sum result.\n\nBut how do I pass the sum into the average expression? Maybe I need to connect the output of sum_expression to a variable and then reference it in the average expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute both expressions in sequence. First, compute the sum, then use that value in the average calculation.\n\nWait, but Midio's nodes are connected via ports, so I can chain them. For example:\n\nsum_expression.result -> avg_expression.gen_0\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each expression node requires all its operands to be provided as inputs. So perhaps it's better to compute the sum first, then use another Math.Expression for average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can create a single Math.Expression that computes both sum and average in one go, but that might complicate things since the output is an Any type which could hold multiple values.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can return an object with two properties: sum and avg.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio? Maybe I need to use a Map node to combine the results into an object.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute sum and average separately and then combine them using a Map or some other function.\n\nLet me think about",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. For a given number n, the function should compute two things: the sum of all numbers from 1 to n, and the average of those numbers. The average is just the sum divided by n.\n\nI remember that the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward mathematical approach. So instead of looping through each number, which might be less efficient, I can directly compute the sum using this formula.\n\nNext, for the average, once I have the sum, I just divide it by n.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function has an input string and needs to output the first character that appears more than once. The signature shows inputs for execute trigger and the string, and outputs for continue trigger and the char.\n\nI remember that Midio uses nodes for functions. So I'll probably need to process each character in the string, keep track of characters we've seen, and check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in a tracking structure (like a set or list).\n4. If it is, return this as the first repeated character.\n5. If not, add it to the tracking structure and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the Iteration.Map node to process each character. Maybe also use List.Contains to check if the character exists in a list that tracks seen characters.\n\nWait, but how do I maintain state between iterations? Since each iteration is processed separately, I might need to accumulate the seen characters as I go.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a variable or another function to keep track of the seen characters. But Midio doesn't support variables directly; instead, we can use properties in nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each character, add it to a list and then check if the next characters are present in that list.\n\nWait, but processing in order is important because I need the first occurrence where a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me outline the steps with Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by getting the string input.\n- Split the string into individual characters. The Strings.Characters node can do this, outputting a list of characters.\n- Then, iterate over each character in this list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each character, check if it exists in a list of seen characters.\n- If it does, set this as the result and stop further processing.\n- If not, add it to the seen characters list.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the seen characters across iterations? Since each map iteration is independent, maybe I need to use a function that accumulates the seen characters.\n\nWait, perhaps using a reduce approach. The Iteration.Reduce node can help accumulate the seen characters and check for duplicates as we go.\n\nAlternatively, in the map handler, for each character, check against all previous ones. But that might not be efficient, but for simplicity, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about using a list to track seen characters. For each character in the string:\n\n1. Check if it exists in the seen list.\n2. If yes, return it as the first repeated.\n3. If no, add it to the seen list and proceed.\n\nIn Midio, I can use List.Contains for step 1. So, for each character, pass it to a List.Contains node that checks against the seen list.\n\nBut how do I build the seen list incrementally? Maybe using a function that appends each new character.\n\nWait, perhaps in the map handler, for each element (character), we can have two outputs: one for the result if found, and another for updating the seen list. But Midio's nodes might not support this directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a nested structure where for each character, we check against all previous ones. But that could be inefficient, but perhaps acceptable for simplicity.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of the first duplicate found. Once found, stop processing further characters.\n\nSo, using Iteration.Map, for each character at index i:\n\n- Check if any character from 0 to i-1 equals current character.\n- If yes, return it as the result.\n\nThis can be done by comparing the substring up to i with the rest.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I get the substring? The Strings.Slice node can help. So for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character exists in that substring.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because we're processing each character one by one, so perhaps it's better to build a list of seen characters as we go.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Iteration.Map on this list, where each handler processes a character and checks if it's in the seen list.\n3. The map handler needs access to the seen list built so far.\n\nBut since each iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a shared variable. So perhaps instead, for each character, pass along the current state of the seen list.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether a duplicate was found and the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it's in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, set the result and stop processing.\n  - If no, add it to the accumulator.\n- The reduce node can then output the first duplicate found.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support stopping early; it processes all elements unless I find a way to short-circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the reduce handler, once a duplicate is found, we can set a flag and ignore further processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that in Midio? Maybe using a property to track whether we've found the result yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nUsing Iteration.Map:\n\n- For each character, check if it exists in any of the previous characters.\n- The first time this is true, return it as the result.\n\nBut how do I access all previous characters up to the current index? Maybe for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character is present.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing the index. Alternatively, perhaps using a variable to track the first duplicate found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a function that iterates through each character, keeping a list of seen characters, and returns as soon as a duplicate is found.\n\nBut in Midio, functions can't have variables; they process data as it comes in. So I need to find a way to maintain state across iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using the continue trigger to chain the processing. Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's in the seen list.\n  - If yes, set the result and break the loop.\n  - If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe by using a function that appends to a list property.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't support modifying properties directly in this way. So perhaps each iteration can pass along the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a reduce approach where each step adds the character to the seen list and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me try structuring it with Reduce:\n\n- The initial accumulator is an empty list.\n- For each character:\n  - Check if it's in the accumulator.\n    - If yes, return",

So for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character exists in that substring.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because we're processing each character one by one, so perhaps it's better to build a list of seen characters as we go.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Iteration.Map on this list, where each handler processes a character and checks if it's in the seen list.\n3. The map handler needs access to the seen list built so far.\n\nBut since each iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a shared variable. So perhaps instead, for each character, pass along the current state of the seen list.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether a duplicate was found and the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it's in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, set the result and stop processing.\n  - If no, add it to the accumulator.\n- The reduce node can then output the first duplicate found.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support stopping early; it processes all elements unless I find a way to short-circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the reduce handler, once a duplicate is found, we can set a flag and ignore further processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that in Midio? Maybe using a property to track whether we've found the result yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nUsing Iteration.Map:\n\n- For each character, check if it exists in any of the previous characters.\n- The first time this is true, return it as the result.\n\nBut how do I access all previous characters up to the current index? Maybe for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character is present.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing the index. Alternatively, perhaps using a variable to track the first duplicate found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a function that iterates through each character, keeping a list of seen characters, and returns as soon as a duplicate is found.\n\nBut in Midio, functions can't have variables; they process data as it comes in. So I need to find a way to maintain state across iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using the continue trigger to chain the processing. Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's in the seen list.\n  - If yes, set the result and break the loop.\n  - If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe by using a function that appends to a list property.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't support modifying properties directly in this way. So perhaps each iteration can pass along the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a reduce approach where each step adds the character to the seen list and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me try structuring it with Reduce:\n\n- The initial accumulator is an empty list.\n- For each character:\n  - Check if it's in the accumulator.\n    - If yes, return",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function has an input string and needs to output the first character that appears more than once. The signature shows inputs for execute trigger and the string, and outputs for continue trigger and the char.\n\nI remember that Midio uses nodes for functions. So I'll probably need to process each character in the string, keep track of characters we've seen, and check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in a tracking structure (like a set or list).\n4. If it is, return this as the first repeated character.\n5. If not, add it to the tracking structure and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the Iteration.Map node to process each character.

Since each map iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a variable.

Maybe in the map handler, for each character, I can have two outputs: one for the result (if found) and another for the updated seen list.\n\nWait, perhaps using a custom function that does this.

Once a character is processed, add it to a seen list and pass it along for the next iteration.\n\nBut this might require multiple passes or nested functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a loop with For and process each character step by step, maintaining the seen list as a property.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Std.For node to iterate over each character in order. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's in the seen list.\n  - If yes, set the result and break the loop.\n  - If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I maintain the seen list across iterations? Maybe by using a function that appends to a list property.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't support modifying properties directly in this way. So perhaps each iteration can pass along the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a reduce approach where each step adds the character to the seen list and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me try structuring it with Reduce:\n\n- The initial accumulator is an empty list.\n- For each character:\n  - Check if it's in the accumulator.\n    - If yes, return",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function has an input string and needs to output the first character that appears more than once. The signature shows inputs for execute trigger and the string, and outputs for continue trigger and the char.\n\nI remember that Midio uses nodes for functions. So I'll probably need to process each character in the string, keep track of characters we've seen, and check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n1. Take the input string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it's already in a tracking structure (like a set or list).\n4. If it is, return this as the first repeated character.\n5. If not, add it to the tracking structure and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the Iteration.Map node to process each character. Maybe also use List.Contains to check if the character exists in a list that tracks seen characters.\n\nWait, but how do I maintain state between iterations? Since each iteration is processed separately, I might need to accumulate the seen characters as I go.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a variable or another function to keep track of the seen characters. But Midio doesn't support variables directly; instead, we can use properties in nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each character, add it to a list and then check if the next characters are present in that list.\n\nWait, but processing in order is important because I need the first occurrence where a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me outline the steps with Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by getting the string input.\n- Split the string into individual characters. The Strings.Characters node can do this, outputting a list of characters.\n- Then, iterate over each character in this list using Iteration.Map.\n- For each character, check if it exists in a list of seen characters.\n- If it does, set this as the result and stop further processing.\n- If not, add it to the seen characters list.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the seen characters across iterations? Since each map iteration is independent, maybe I need to use a function that accumulates the seen characters.\n\nWait, perhaps using a reduce approach. The Iteration.Reduce node can help accumulate the seen characters and check for duplicates as we go.\n\nAlternatively, in the map handler, for each character, check against all previous ones. But that might not be efficient, but for simplicity, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me think about using a list to track seen characters. For each character in the string:\n\n1. Check if it exists in the seen list.\n2. If yes, return it as the first repeated.\n3. If no, add it to the seen list and proceed.\n\nIn Midio, I can use List.Contains for step 1. So, for each character, pass it to a List.Contains node that checks against the seen list.\n\nBut how do I build the seen list incrementally? Maybe using a function that appends each new character.\n\nWait, perhaps in the map handler, for each element (character), we can have two outputs: one for the result if found, and another for updating the seen list. But Midio's nodes might not support this directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a nested structure where for each character, we check against all previous ones. But that could be inefficient, but perhaps acceptable for simplicity.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of the first duplicate found. Once found, stop processing further characters.\n\nSo, using Iteration.Map, for each character at index i:\n\n- Check if any character from 0 to i-1 equals current character.\n- If yes, return it as the result.\n\nThis can be done by comparing the substring up to i with the rest.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I get the substring? The Strings.Slice node can help. So for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character exists in that substring.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014because we're processing each character one by one, so perhaps it's better to build a list of seen characters as we go.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Iteration.Map on this list, where each handler processes a character and checks if it's in the seen list.\n3. The map handler needs access to the seen list built so far.\n\nBut since each iteration is separate, I can't directly modify a shared variable. So perhaps instead, for each character, pass along the current state of the seen list.\n\nWait, maybe using a function that takes both the current character and the seen list, then returns whether a duplicate was found and the updated seen list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a reduce approach where each step accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nLet me think about using Iteration.Reduce:\n\n- Initialize an empty list as the accumulator.\n- For each character, check if it's in the accumulator.\n  - If yes, set the result and stop processing.\n  - If no, add it to the accumulator.\n- The reduce node can then output the first duplicate found.\n\nBut Midio's reduce node might not support stopping early; it processes all elements unless I find a way to short-circuit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the reduce handler, once a duplicate is found, we can set a flag and ignore further processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that in Midio? Maybe using a property to track whether we've found the result yet.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n\nUsing Iteration.Map:\n\n- For each character, check if it exists in any of the previous characters.\n- The first time this is true, return it as the result.\n\nBut how do I access all previous characters up to the current index? Maybe for each index i, take the substring from 0 to i and check if the current character is present.\n\nWait, but that would require knowing the index. Alternatively, perhaps using a variable to track the first duplicate found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a function that iterates through each character, keeping a list of seen characters, and returns as soon as a duplicate is found.\n\nBut in Midio, functions can't have variables; they process data as it comes in. So I need to find a way to maintain state across iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using the continue trigger to chain the processing.

If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order. Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest.

Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list. Then, get the length of sorted_list using List.Length. If the length is less than 2, maybe set output to null. Otherwise, take the element at index 1.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. Get the element at index 1 of the sorted list.\n3.

Maybe add a check before accessing index 1.\n\nAlternatively, proceed without checking, as per the problem's assumption that the list is valid.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Create an instance of List.Sort, connect it to the input list.\n- Then, create an instance of List.GetAt with index 1 connected to the sorted list.\n- The result goes to the output property.\n\nBut I need to structure this within the function's nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute the second smallest without additional steps.

Once sorted, the second element would be the second smallest. But wait, what if there are duplicate smallest numbers? For example, [1, 1, 2], the second smallest is still 1. So sorting and then picking the second element should work.\n\nBut I also need to consider cases where the list has less than two elements. In that case, maybe return null or handle it appropriately. However, the function's output is of type Any, so perhaps we can assume the input list has at least two elements, or handle it by returning null if not.\n\nNow, how to structure this in Midio. The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Iteration functions like Find could help. For example, find the smallest number, remove it from the list, then find the next smallest. That might handle duplicates correctly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the list in ascending order.\n2. Check if the sorted list has at least two elements.\n3. If yes, return the second element.\n4. If no, perhaps return null or handle accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio using the available functions.\n\nLooking at the external functions, I can use List.Sort to get a sorted list. Then, maybe use List.GetAt with index 1 to get the second smallest. But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list. Then, get the length of sorted_list using List.Length. If the length is less than 2, maybe set output to null. Otherwise, take the element at index 1.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. Get the element at index 1 of the sorted list.\n3. Return this as the output.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio's nodes.\n\nLooking at the function signature, I need to create a function with an input list and execute trigger, and outputs continue and output.\n\nI can use List.Sort on the input list. Then, perhaps use List.GetAt to get index 1.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check before accessing index 1.\n\nAlternatively, proceed without checking, as per the problem's assumption that the list is valid.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Create an instance of List.Sort, connect it to the input list.\n- Then, create an instance of List.GetAt with index 1 connected to the sorted list.\n- The result goes to the output property.\n\nBut I need to structure this within the function's nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute the second smallest without additional steps. For example, after sorting, take the element at position 2 (since indexing starts at 0). So index 1 is the second element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use an expression that computes min of the list, then finds the next min in the filtered list.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to sort and pick the second element.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Use List.Sort on the input list.\n- Then, get the length of the sorted list. If length >=2, take index 1; else, return null or handle accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I conditionally set the output based on the length?\n\nI can use a Std.If node to check if the length is less than 2. If so, set output to null; else, get the second element.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Sort the list.\n2. Get its length.\n3. Use Math.LessThan to compare length < 2.\n4. If true, output is null.\n5. Else, get index 1 of sorted list and output it.\n\nThis way, we handle cases where the list has fewer than two elements.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio's node flow.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- List.Sort instance connected to input list.\n- List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Math.LessThan to check if length < 2.\n- Std.If to choose between null and index 1.\n\nThen, connect the If's value to the output.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ninstance(x: ...) sort_list root.Std_k98ojb.List.Sort {}\ninput_list -> sort_list.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) sorted_length root.Std_k98ojb.List.Length {}\nsort_list.result -> sorted_length.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) less_than root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\nsorted_length.result -> less_than.left\n2 -> less_than.right\n\ninstance(x: ...) if_node root.Std_k98ojb.Std.If {}\nless_than.result -> if_node.predicate\n\nThen, for the true",

But I need to ensure that the list has at least two elements.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is:\n\n- Find the minimum value in the list.\n- Remove all occurrences of this minimum.\n- If the resulting list is not empty, the new minimum is the second smallest.\n- Otherwise, there's no second smallest (if original list had only one element or all same).\n\nBut implementing this might require more steps.\n\nLet me think about which approach is easier in Midio. Using List.Sort seems straightforward. So:\n\n1. Use List.Sort on the input list to get a sorted list.\n2. Check if the length of the sorted list is at least 2.\n3. If yes, return the element at index 1.\n4. Else, perhaps return null.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow.\n\nI can create a sorted_list by using List.Sort on the input list. Then, get the length of sorted_list using List.Length. If the length is less than 2, maybe set output to null. Otherwise, take the element at index 1.\n\nWait, but what if all elements are the same? Like [5,5,5]. The second smallest would still be 5, which is correct.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Connect the input list to List.Sort.\n- Then, use List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Use a Math.LessThan predicate to check if length < 2. If so, output null.\n- Else, get the second element using List.GetAt with index 1.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is of type Any, which can handle null or numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an expression to compute the second smallest without additional checks, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, another approach: after sorting, if there are duplicates in the first position, the second element would still be correct. For example, [1,1,2], sorted is same, index 1 is 1, which is correct as the second smallest.\n\nSo, perhaps just sorting and taking index 1 is sufficient.\n\nBut what about an empty list or a single-element list? The function's output might need to handle that, but since the problem says \"a list,\" I'll assume it has at least two elements. Or maybe in Midio, if the list is too short, List.GetAt returns null, which we can then check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using an expression with Math functions to find the second smallest without sorting, but that might be more complex.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the input list in ascending order.\n2. Get the element at index 1 of the sorted list.\n3. Return this as the output.\n\nBut how to implement this in Midio's nodes.\n\nLooking at the function signature, I need to create a function with an input list and execute trigger, and outputs continue and output.\n\nI can use List.Sort on the input list. Then, perhaps use List.GetAt to get index 1.\n\nWait, but what if the list is empty or has one element? Maybe add a check before accessing index 1.\n\nAlternatively, proceed without checking, as per the problem's assumption that the list is valid.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Create an instance of List.Sort, connect it to the input list.\n- Then, create an instance of List.GetAt with index 1 connected to the sorted list.\n- The result goes to the output property.\n\nBut I need to structure this within the function's nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute the second smallest without additional steps. For example, after sorting, take the element at position 2 (since indexing starts at 0). So index 1 is the second element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use an expression that computes min of the list, then finds the next min in the filtered list.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to sort and pick the second element.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Use List.Sort on the input list.\n- Then, get the length of the sorted list. If length >=2, take index 1; else, return null or handle accordingly.\n\nWait, but in Midio, how do I conditionally set the output based on the length?\n\nI can use a Std.If node to check if the length is less than 2. If so, set output to null; else, get the second element.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Sort the list.\n2. Get its length.\n3. Use Math.LessThan to compare length < 2.\n4. If true, output is null.\n5. Else, get index 1 of sorted list and output it.\n\nThis way, we handle cases where the list has fewer than two elements.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio's node flow.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- List.Sort instance connected to input list.\n- List.Length on the sorted list.\n- Math.LessThan to check if length < 2.\n- Std.If to choose between null and index 1.\n\nThen, connect the If's value to the output.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ninstance(x: ...) sort_list root.Std_k98ojb.List.Sort {}\ninput_list -> sort_list.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) sorted_length root.Std_k98ojb.List.Length {}\nsort_list.result -> sorted_length.list\n\ninstance(x: ...) less_than root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\nsorted_length.result -> less_than.left\n2 -> less_than.right\n\ninstance(x: ...) if_node root.Std_k98ojb.Std.If {}\nless_than.result -> if_node.predicate\n\nThen, for the true",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called second_smallest that finds the second smallest number in a list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. The task is to take a list of numbers and return the second smallest one. If there are duplicates or fewer than two elements, I need to handle those cases as well.\n\nLooking at the provided functions, I see that List.Sort can sort the list in ascending order.

The function signature has an input list and an execute trigger. The outputs are a continue trigger and an output property.\n\nI think I'll use List.Sort to sort the list. Then, after sorting, extract the second element. But wait, what if the list is empty or has one element?

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Compare each element with the target.\n- When an element matches, store its index.\n- After the loop, return the stored index if any match was found.\n\nI'll need to set up the For loop to iterate over the list. The 'item' output will give me each element, and I can compare it using Logic.Equal or a Math.Expression.\n\nWait, but in Midio, comparing objects might require a deep scan, which could be an issue if elements are complex. But since we're dealing with numbers, maybe it's okay.\n\nI'll set up the For loop to iterate over the list. Each item is checked against the target element. If they are equal, I'll record the index.\n\nBut how do I track the index? The For loop provides the index as an output property. So I can use that.\n\nWait, looking back at the function signature, the inputs are 'list', 'elem', and 'execute'. The outputs are 'index' and 'continue'.\n\nSo in the code:\n\n- Connect the list to the For loop's items.\n- Use a variable to track whether the element has been found.\n- For each item, check if it equals elem. If yes, set the index output.\n- After processing all items, if found, return true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in Midio, I can't directly store variables unless using some stateful nodes, which I don't think are available here. So perhaps I need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a sorted array, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut without state, maybe the simplest way is to iterate from the end and return the first match.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have reverse iteration directly. So perhaps using a For loop with index and checking each element in reverse order isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate a range from 0 to length-1 and then iterate in reverse order.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to use a linear search from the end.\n\nWait, but how do I get the elements in reverse order? The For loop gives items in their natural order. So perhaps I need to reverse the list first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find all indices where the element occurs and then take the maximum index.\n\nBut that would require collecting all matches, which might not be efficient, but given Midio's constraints, it could work.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over each element with its index.\n2. For each element, check if it equals the target.\n3. If it does, collect the index.\n4. After processing all elements, find the maximum index where the condition was true.\n5. Return that index.\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio nodes?\n\nI can use a Map handler to process each element and its index. For each element, if it equals elem, store the index.\n\nWait, but storing variables isn't straightforward. So perhaps I can collect all indices where the condition is true into a list, then find the maximum of that list.\n\nSo:\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indexes from 0 to length-1.\n- Map each index to check if the corresponding element equals elem.\n- Collect the indexes where this is true.\n- If the collected list is not empty, return its last element (or max), else return null or false.\n\nBut how do I get the corresponding element for each index? Because in Midio, you can't directly access an element by index unless you have a function to do so.\n\nWait, perhaps using List.GetItemAtIndex. But looking at the available nodes, there's no such node. So maybe that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, use a For loop with index and item, but I'm not sure how to get both.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: iterate through each element, keep track of whether it's equal to elem, and if so, store the current index as the last one.\n\nBut without state variables, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable in the function scope. But Midio functions are stateless unless you use some external storage, which isn't available here.\n\nSo maybe I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is sorted, once I find an occurrence, I can continue searching until the end to find the last one.\n\nBut again, without state, it's hard to track.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop and for each item, if it equals elem, set the index output. But how do I ensure that after all items are processed, the last occurrence is captured?\n\nBecause as soon as an item matches, the index is set, but subsequent matches will overwrite it. So by the end of the loop, the index should be the last one.\n\nWait, no. Because in a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and if I set the index output each time, the last one would indeed be the last occurrence.\n\nSo here's how:\n\n- Connect the list to For.items.\n- In the handler, for each item, check if it equals elem.\n- If yes, set the index output to the current index (from For.index).\n- After all items are processed, return whether any were found.\n\nBut in Midio, I can't directly access the index within the handler unless the For loop provides it. Looking back at the function signature, the For loop's 'index' is an output property, so perhaps I can connect that to a variable.\n\nWait, but in the code, how do I capture the index for each item? Maybe using a Math.Add node to track the current index.\n\nAlternatively, use the For.index directly. So in the handler, for each item, if it equals elem, set the output index to For.index.\n\nBut then, after all items are processed, the last occurrence would be the correct one.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Use a For loop connected to the list.\n- In the handler",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this.

Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense.

So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called 'last' that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the function signature has inputs for the list, the element to find, and an execute trigger. The outputs are the index where the element is found and a continue trigger.\n\nSince the array is sorted, I can take advantage of binary search to efficiently find the last occurrence. But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index.

But Midio doesn't have a built-in binary search node, so I'll need to implement it using available functions.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Check if the list is empty**: If it's empty, return false and continue.\n2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of the left and right boundaries of the search range.\n3. **Binary Search for the element**:\n   - Find the first occurrence using binary search.\n   - Once found, continue searching to the right to find the last occurrence.\n4. **Return the index**: If found, return the index; otherwise, return null or false.\n\nWait, but Midio's functions are node-based, so I need to structure this with the available nodes like For loop, List operations, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, maybe a linear search from the end would be simpler. But for large lists, that's inefficient. However, given the constraints of Midio's nodes, perhaps a linear approach is more straightforward.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop to iterate through the list backwards and find the last occurrence.\n\nHere's how I can structure it:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each element.\n- Keep track of the index.\n- Check if the current element equals the target.\n- If found, store the index. Since we're looping from the end, the first match is the last occurrence.\n- After the loop, return the stored index.\n\nWait, but the For loop in Midio iterates from start to finish. So maybe I can reverse the list and then find the first occurrence, which would be the last in the original list.\n\nAlternatively, iterate normally and keep updating the index whenever the element is found. The last update will be the correct index.\n\nLet me plan the nodes:\n\n1. **For loop**: Iterate over each item in the list.\n2. **Check equality**: Use Logic.Equal to compare each item with the target element.\n3. **Store index if match**: If equal, store the current index.\n4. After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how do I keep track of the index? The For loop provides the index as an output. So for each iteration, I can capture the index and check if the item matches.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function instance is stateless, so I need a way to remember the last index where the element was found. Maybe using a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a Math.Min or Max isn't helpful here. Alternatively, I can use a List.Find node with a custom predicate that checks for equality and returns the index. But Midio's Find might only return the first occurrence.\n\nWait, looking at the nodes available:\n\n- Std.For: Loops through each item, provides item and index.\n- Iteration.Map: Can process each item and maybe track the index.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of indices from 0 to length-1.\n2. Use Iteration.Map to iterate over these indices, getting both index and element.\n3. For each index, check if the element at that position equals the target.\n4. If it does, store this index as a candidate.\n5. After processing all elements, return the maximum index where the condition was true.\n\nBut how to track the maximum index? Maybe use Math.Add to keep adding 1 each time a match is found, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, in the Map handler, whenever a match is found, set a variable to the current index. Since we're iterating from start to end, the last such assignment will be the correct index.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming. So perhaps I can use a List.Find or similar node that processes each element and keeps track of the result.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a For loop with a handler that checks each item. Each time the item matches, update an output variable with the current index. Since we're looping from start to end, the last update will be the correct one.\n\nBut how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Create a For loop instance (Std.For) connected to the list.\n- In the handler of For.onItem, check if the item equals the target element.\n- If yes, set the output index to the current index provided by For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut in Midio, each node is stateless, so I need a way to capture this. Maybe use an instance of Math.Add or another node that can accumulate the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns true when the element matches and also captures the index. But I'm not sure if Find can return the index directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can reverse the list and find the first occurrence, which would correspond to the last in the original list. Then subtract from the length to get the correct index.\n\nBut reversing a list might be an extra step that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, iterate through each element using For, and for each item, if it matches, store the current index. Since we're going from start to end, the last stored index is the answer.\n\nSo in terms of nodes:\n\n- Connect the list to Std.For.items.\n- In For.onItem, check if the item equals elem_94ca57 using Logic.Equal.\n- If true, set the output index_fc05e7 to For.index.\n- After all items are processed, return the stored index.\n\nBut how to structure this in Midio's node-based flow. Each time an item is processed, if it matches, update the index output.\n\nWait, perhaps using a Math.Expression to compute whether the current item equals the target and then use that result with Logic.And or similar to set the index.\n\nAlternatively, I can have a handler function inside For.onItem that checks each element and updates the index accordingly.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are defined with inputs and outputs. So perhaps:\n\n- The For loop's onItem trigger is connected to an If node.\n- The If node checks if the current item equals the target.\n- If true, set the output index to For.index.\n- Then connect this to a variable or another node that accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but Midio doesn't have variables in the same sense. So perhaps I can use a List.Find with a custom predicate that returns the index when the element is found, and then find the maximum such index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a Math.Add to keep track of the last index where the condition was met.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.\n\n1. The function receives 'list' (a list of numbers), 'elem' (the target element), and an execute trigger.\n2. I need to find the highest index 'i' such that list[i] == elem.\n3. Since the list is sorted, all occurrences are contiguous, but even if not, this approach should work.\n\nSo, in Midio:\n\n- Use Std.For to loop through each item in the list.\n- For each iteration, get the current item and its index.\n- Check if the item equals 'elem' using Logic.Equal"
