                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character.

Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5.

Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations.

Some way to return the first repeated character as soon as it's found.\n\nWait, but Midio functions are reactive and don't support early returns directly. So I need a way to stop processing once the first duplicate is found. Hmm, perhaps using an If condition within the loop to break out early if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, since we're using a For loop which processes each item in sequence, as soon as a duplicate is found, we can set the output and then trigger the continue event to exit the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n- Use List.Empty to create an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration, check if the current character is in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If it is, set the output property and trigger continue.\n- If not, add the current character to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I modify the seen list within the loop? Since List.Add creates a new list, I can use a setter to update the seen list each time a new character is added.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to loop over each character in the characters list.\n4. For each character:\n   a. Check if it exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   b. If it does, set the output property to this character and trigger continue.\n   c. If not, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut wait, how do I pass the current character to the List.Contains check? The For loop's onItem event gives access to the item being processed, so in the function, I can connect that to the List.Contains input.\n\nAlso, each time a new character is added to the seen list, I need to update the setter so that subsequent iterations have the updated list.\n\nLet me think about the node connections:\n\n- The output of Strings.Characters goes into Std.For.items.\n- The seen list starts as empty from List.Empty.\n- For each item (character) in Std.For.items:\n   - Connect to List.Contains.left.\n   - The seen list is connected to List.Contains.right.\n   - If List.Contains.result is true, then we have a duplicate; set the output and continue.\n   - Else, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I trigger this for each item? Maybe using an Iteration.Map inside the For loop to process each item with a handler that performs the check and updates the seen list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a function within the For loop's onItem event to handle each character.\n\nWait, Midio allows functions to be defined inline. So, I can create a sub-function within the main function that processes each character.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nfunc first_repeated_char {\n    in execute trigger\n    in string property (String)\n    out continue trigger\n    out char property (Any)\n\n    \n    strings_characters = Strings.Characters(string)\n\n    \n    seen_list = List.Empty()\n\n    \n    for_each_char in Std.For(strings_characters) {\n        current_char = for_each_char.item\n\n        \n        contains = List.Contains(seen_list, current_char)\n\n        if contains {\n            char = current_char\n            continue\n        } else {\n            seen_list = List",

Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a For loop with some conditional logic would be better.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't directly handle state between iterations. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a List. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. List.Empty: To initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Std.For: To iterate over the characters list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual or List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n5. List.Add: To add the current character to the seen list if it's not already present.\n6. An If statement (Std.If) to decide whether to return the current character as the first repeated one.\n\nWait, but how do I stop the function once I find the first repeated character? Because in Midio, functions are event-driven, so perhaps using a trigger-based approach where upon finding the first duplicate, we set the output and then continue or reset the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the function needs to return the first occurrence of a repeated character, maybe it's better to process each character sequentially, checking against the seen list, and once found, return it immediately.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by converting the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if the character is present in the seen list using List.Contains.\n  - If it is, set the output and trigger the continue event.\n  - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed to the next character.\n\nBut how do I handle this sequentially? Because Midio processes nodes in a flow, so perhaps using a For loop with an index, and for each item, perform the check and update the seen list accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't necessary. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but within that map handler, manage the state of the seen characters using setters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For loop and some conditional logic would be better.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Iterate over each character in the characters list:\n   a. Check if the current character is in the seen list.\n   b. If yes, set the output and continue.\n   c. If no, add it to the seen list.\n4. Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations?

Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",

An If statement (Std.If) to decide whether to return the current character as the first repeated one.\n\nWait, but how do I stop the function once I find the first repeated character? Because in Midio, functions are event-driven, so perhaps using a trigger-based approach where upon finding the first duplicate, we set the output and then continue or reset the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the function needs to return the first occurrence of a repeated character, maybe it's better to process each character sequentially, checking against the seen list, and once found, return it immediately.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by converting the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if the character is present in the seen list using List.Contains.\n  - If it is, set the output and trigger the continue event.\n  - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed to the next character.\n\nBut how do I handle this sequentially? Because Midio processes nodes in a flow, so perhaps using a For loop with an index, and for each item, perform the check and update the seen list accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't necessary. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but within that map handler, manage the state of the seen characters using setters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For loop and some conditional logic would be better.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Iterate over each character in the characters list:\n   a. Check if the current character is in the seen list.\n   b. If yes, set the output and continue.\n   c. If no, add it to the seen list.\n4. Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate event, I need a way to persist the seen list between them. This can be done using setters (variables) in Midio.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.

So I need a way to stop processing once the first duplicate is found. Hmm, perhaps using an If condition within the loop to break out early if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, since we're using a For loop which processes each item in sequence, as soon as a duplicate is found, we can set the output and then trigger the continue event to exit the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n- Use List.Empty to create an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration, check if the current character is in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If it is, set the output property and trigger continue.\n- If not, add the current character to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I modify the seen list within the loop? Since List.Add creates a new list, I can use a setter to update the seen list each time a new character is added.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to loop over each character in the characters list.\n4. For each character:\n   a. Check if it exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   b. If it does, set the output property to this character and trigger continue.\n   c. If not, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut wait, how do I pass the current character to the List.Contains check? The For loop's onItem event gives access to the item being processed, so in the function, I can connect that to the List.Contains input.\n\nAlso, each time a new character is added to the seen list, I need to update the setter so that subsequent iterations have the updated list.\n\nLet me think about the node connections:\n\n- The output of Strings.Characters goes into Std.For.items.\n- The seen list starts as empty from List.Empty.\n- For each item (character) in Std.For.items:\n   - Connect to List.Contains.left.\n   - The seen list is connected to List.Contains.right.\n   - If List.Contains.result is true, then we have a duplicate; set the output and continue.\n   - Else, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I trigger this for each item? Maybe using an Iteration.Map inside the For loop to process each item with a handler that performs the check and updates the seen list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a function within the For loop's onItem event to handle each character.\n\nWait, Midio allows functions to be defined inline. So, I can create a sub-function within the main function that processes each character.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nfunc first_repeated_char {\n    in execute trigger\n    in string property (String)\n    out continue trigger\n    out char property (Any)\n\n    \n    strings_characters = Strings.Characters(string)\n\n    \n    seen_list = List.Empty()\n\n    \n    for_each_char in Std.For(strings_characters) {\n        current_char = for_each_char.item\n\n        \n        contains = List.Contains(seen_list, current_char)\n\n        if contains {\n            char = current_char\n            continue\n        } else {\n            seen_list = List",

Hmm, perhaps using an If condition within the loop to break out early if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, since we're using a For loop which processes each item in sequence, as soon as a duplicate is found, we can set the output and then trigger the continue event to exit the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n- Use List.Empty to create an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration, check if the current character is in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If it is, set the output property and trigger continue.\n- If not, add the current character to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I modify the seen list within the loop? Since List.Add creates a new list, I can use a setter to update the seen list each time a new character is added.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to loop over each character in the characters list.\n4. For each character:\n   a. Check if it exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   b. If it does, set the output property to this character and trigger continue.\n   c. If not, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut wait, how do I pass the current character to the List.Contains check? The For loop's onItem event gives access to the item being processed, so in the function, I can connect that to the List.Contains input.\n\nAlso, each time a new character is added to the seen list, I need to update the setter so that subsequent iterations have the updated list.\n\nLet me think about the node connections:\n\n- The output of Strings.Characters goes into Std.For.items.\n- The seen list starts as empty from List.Empty.\n- For each item (character) in Std.For.items:\n   - Connect to List.Contains.left.\n   - The seen list is connected to List.Contains.right.\n   - If List.Contains.result is true, then we have a duplicate; set the output and continue.\n   - Else, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I trigger this for each item? Maybe using an Iteration.Map inside the For loop to process each item with a handler that performs the check and updates the seen list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a function within the For loop's onItem event to handle each character.\n\nWait, Midio allows functions to be defined inline. So, I can create a sub-function within the main function that processes each character.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nfunc first_repeated_char {\n    in execute trigger\n    in string property (String)\n    out continue trigger\n    out char property (Any)\n\n    \n    strings_characters = Strings.Characters(string)\n\n    \n    seen_list = List.Empty()\n\n    \n    for_each_char in Std.For(strings_characters) {\n        current_char = for_each_char.item\n\n        \n        contains = List.Contains(seen_list, current_char)\n\n        if contains {\n            char = current_char\n            continue\n        } else {\n            seen_list = List",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",

Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate event, I need a way to persist the seen list between them. This can be done using setters (variables) in Midio.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to iterate over each character",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a for loop with some conditionals would work better.\n\nWait, maybe using a for loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't easily allow for state management. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a list. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Std.For: To iterate over this list of characters.\n3. List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",

Because in Midio, functions are event-driven, so perhaps using a trigger-based approach where upon finding the first duplicate, we set the output and then continue or reset the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the function needs to return the first occurrence of a repeated character, maybe it's better to process each character sequentially, checking against the seen list, and once found, return it immediately.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by converting the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if the character is present in the seen list using List.Contains.\n  - If it is, set the output and trigger the continue event.\n  - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed to the next character.\n\nBut how do I handle this sequentially? Because Midio processes nodes in a flow, so perhaps using a For loop with an index, and for each item, perform the check and update the seen list accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't necessary. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but within that map handler, manage the state of the seen characters using setters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For loop and some conditional logic would be better.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Iterate over each character in the characters list:\n   a. Check if the current character is in the seen list.\n   b. If yes, set the output and continue.\n   c. If no, add it to the seen list.\n4. Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate event, I need a way to persist the seen list between them. This can be done using setters (variables) in Midio.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.

So I need a way to stop processing once the first duplicate is found. Hmm, perhaps using an If condition within the loop to break out early if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, since we're using a For loop which processes each item in sequence, as soon as a duplicate is found, we can set the output and then trigger the continue event to exit the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n- Use List.Empty to create an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration, check if the current character is in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If it is, set the output property and trigger continue.\n- If not, add the current character to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I modify the seen list within the loop? Since List.Add creates a new list, I can use a setter to update the seen list each time a new character is added.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to loop over each character in the characters list.\n4. For each character:\n   a. Check if it exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   b. If it does, set the output property to this character and trigger continue.\n   c. If not, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut wait, how do I pass the current character to the List.Contains check? The For loop's onItem event gives access to the item being processed, so in the function, I can connect that to the List.Contains input.\n\nAlso, each time a new character is added to the seen list, I need to update the setter so that subsequent iterations have the updated list.\n\nLet me think about the node connections:\n\n- The output of Strings.Characters goes into Std.For.items.\n- The seen list starts as empty from List.Empty.\n- For each item (character) in Std.For.items:\n   - Connect to List.Contains.left.\n   - The seen list is connected to List.Contains.right.\n   - If List.Contains.result is true, then we have a duplicate; set the output and continue.\n   - Else, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I trigger this for each item? Maybe using an Iteration.Map inside the For loop to process each item with a handler that performs the check and updates the seen list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a function within the For loop's onItem event to handle each character.\n\nWait, Midio allows functions to be defined inline. So, I can create a sub-function within the main function that processes each character.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nfunc first_repeated_char {\n    in execute trigger\n    in string property (String)\n    out continue trigger\n    out char property (Any)\n\n    \n    strings_characters = Strings.Characters(string)\n\n    \n    seen_list = List.Empty()\n\n    \n    for_each_char in Std.For(strings_characters) {\n        current_char = for_each_char.item\n\n        \n        contains = List.Contains(seen_list, current_char)\n\n        if contains {\n            char = current_char\n            continue\n        } else {\n            seen_list = List",

Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a For loop with some conditional logic would be better.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't directly handle state between iterations. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a List. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. List.Empty: To initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Std.For: To iterate over the characters list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual or List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n5. List.Add: To add the current character to the seen list if it's not already present.\n6. An If statement (Std.If) to decide whether to return the current character as the first repeated one.\n\nWait, but how do I stop the function once I find the first repeated character? Because in Midio, functions are event-driven, so perhaps using a trigger-based approach where upon finding the first duplicate, we set the output and then continue or reset the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the function needs to return the first occurrence of a repeated character, maybe it's better to process each character sequentially, checking against the seen list, and once found, return it immediately.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by converting the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if the character is present in the seen list using List.Contains.\n  - If it is, set the output and trigger the continue event.\n  - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed to the next character.\n\nBut how do I handle this sequentially? Because Midio processes nodes in a flow, so perhaps using a For loop with an index, and for each item, perform the check and update the seen list accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't necessary. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but within that map handler, manage the state of the seen characters using setters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For loop and some conditional logic would be better.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Iterate over each character in the characters list:\n   a. Check if the current character is in the seen list.\n   b. If yes, set the output and continue.\n   c. If no, add it to the seen list.\n4. Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate event, I need a way to persist the seen list between them. This can be done using setters (variables) in Midio.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to iterate over each character",

List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual: To trigger when the character isn't in the seen list, allowing us to add it.\n5. List.Add: To add the new character to the seen list.\n6. Std.If or Std.IfExpression: To decide whether to return the character as repeated or continue processing.\n\nWait, but how do I handle returning the first occurrence? Once a character is found that's in the seen list, I need to output it and stop further processing.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use a for loop (Std.For) on the characters list.\n- For each item (character), check if List.Contains returns true when checking against the seen list.\n- If yes, use an If node to set the output and trigger continue.\n- If no, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are stateless, so I need a way to maintain the seen list across iterations. This suggests that I should use a setter to hold the current state of the seen list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Initialize a setter (let's call it seen_chars) with an empty list.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if List.Contains(seen_chars.value, current_char) is true.\n  - If yes, set the output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - If no, add current_char to seen_chars using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I connect this within Midio's node-based flow?\n\nPerhaps:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Use Std.For to iterate over this list.\n3. For each item (current character), check if it exists in the seen_chars list using List.Contains.\n4. If it does, use an If node to set the output and continue.\n5. If not, add the current character to seen_chars.\n\nBut I need to manage the seen_chars state across iterations. So:\n\n- Create a setter (seen_chars) initialized with an empty list.\n- For each iteration of Std.For:\n  - Use List.Contains with seen_chars.value as the list and current_char as the item.\n  - If found, set output to current_char and trigger continue.\n  - Else, use List.Add to add current_char to seen_chars.value, updating the setter.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function is stateless, so I need to manage this through setters and triggers. Let me outline the steps with nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list.\n- List.Empty: create an empty list for seen_chars.\n- Setter (seen_chars) initialized to the empty list.\n- Std.For loop on characters_list:\n  - For each item, current_char:\n    - Check if current_char is in seen_chars.value using List.Contains.\n    - If yes, set output and continue.\n    - Else, add current_char to seen_chars.\n\nBut how do I connect this? Let me think about the flow:\n\n1. Convert string to characters list.\n2. Initialize seen_chars as empty list.\n3. Iterate over each character in characters_list:\n   a. Check if character is in seen_chars.\n   b. If yes, output it and stop.\n   c. If no, add to seen_chars.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but since I need to maintain state (seen_chars), perhaps using a for loop with conditionals is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a recursive approach where after processing each character, the function calls itself with the updated seen list until a duplicate is found or all characters are processed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support recursion directly in functions. So I need to manage this within a single function using loops and state variables.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes:\n\n- Strings.Characters: string_71a657 -> characters_list",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called first_repeated_char that finds the first repeated character in a given string. The function should take an input string and output the first character that appears more than once. If there are no repeated characters, it should probably return null or something similar, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume returning the first occurrence is enough.\n\nFirst, I'll think about how to approach this in Midio. Since Midio uses a node-based programming model, I need to connect various function nodes together.\n\nThe steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Iterate through each character in the string.\n2. Keep track of characters we've already seen.\n3. For each character, check if it's been seen before.\n4. If it has, return that character as the first repeated one.\n5. If not, add it to the set of seen characters and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a loop construct like Std.For to iterate over the string. But since strings aren't directly iterable in Midio, I'll need to convert the string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n\nSo, first step: Use Strings.Characters to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nNext, I'll use a loop (Std.For) to go through each character. For each iteration, I need to check if the current character has been seen before.\n\nTo keep track of seen characters, I can maintain a list that starts empty. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; otherwise, return it as the first repeated.\n\nBut how do I manage state between iterations? Midio functions are stateless by default, so I need to use some nodes that can hold state across triggers. Looking at the provided external functions, List.Add and List.Remove can help modify lists, but they create new lists each time. However, in a loop, each iteration is separate, so I might need to accumulate the seen characters over iterations.\n\nWait, perhaps using a variable (a setter) to keep track of the seen characters list would work. Each time we process a character, if it's not in the seen list, add it; else, return it.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n- Loop through each character in the characters list:\n  - For the current character, check if it exists in the seen list.\n  - If it does, this is the first repeated character; return it.\n  - If not, add it to the seen list and continue.\n\nIn Midio, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character. Alternatively, a Std.For loop could be used, but since we need to check against a growing list of seen characters, perhaps using a For loop with some conditional logic would be better.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't the best approach here because it's designed for iterating over lists and doesn't directly handle state between iterations. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map combined with a setter to accumulate the seen characters.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to iterate through each character in order and keep track of which ones have been seen using a List. For each character:\n\n- Check if it's already in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it.\n- If no, add it to the seen list.\n\nSo, I'll need to use a loop that processes each character one by one, updating the seen list as we go.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Strings.Characters: To convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. List.Empty: To initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Std.For: To iterate over the characters list.\n4. Logic.NotEqual or List.Contains: To check if the current character is in the seen list.\n5. List.Add: To add the current character to the seen list if it's not already present.\n6. An If statement (Std.If) to decide whether to return the current character as the first repeated one.\n\nWait, but how do I stop the function once I find the first repeated character? Because in Midio, functions are event-driven, so perhaps using a trigger-based approach where upon finding the first duplicate, we set the output and then continue or reset the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the function needs to return the first occurrence of a repeated character, maybe it's better to process each character sequentially, checking against the seen list, and once found, return it immediately.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n- Start by converting the input string into a list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- For each character in the characters list:\n  - Check if the character is present in the seen list using List.Contains.\n  - If it is, set the output and trigger the continue event.\n  - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed to the next character.\n\nBut how do I handle this sequentially? Because Midio processes nodes in a flow, so perhaps using a For loop with an index, and for each item, perform the check and update the seen list accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe using a For loop isn't necessary. Instead, I can use an Iteration.Map to process each character, but within that map handler, manage the state of the seen characters using setters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For loop and some conditional logic would be better.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n3. Iterate over each character in the characters list:\n   a. Check if the current character is in the seen list.\n   b. If yes, set the output and continue.\n   c. If no, add it to the seen list.\n4. Continue until all characters are processed or a duplicate is found.\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this with:\n\n- A List.GenerateRange from 0 to length of characters minus one to get indices.\n- For each index, get the character at that position using List.GetAt.\n- Then, for each character, check if it's in the seen list.\n- If yes, return it; else, add to seen.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to use an Iteration.Map with a handler function that accumulates the seen characters and checks for duplicates.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Map processes all items and returns a new list based on the handler. That might not be suitable here because we need to stop processing once a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, using a For loop with triggers might allow us to break out of the loop early when a duplicate is found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters to get the list of characters.\n- Initialize an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration:\n   - Check if the current character exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   - If it does, set the output and trigger continue.\n   - If not, add the character to the seen list and proceed.\n\nBut how do I manage the seen list across iterations? Since each iteration is a separate event, I need a way to persist the seen list between them. This can be done using setters (variables) in Midio.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to iterate over each character",

Some way to return the first repeated character as soon as it's found.\n\nWait, but Midio functions are reactive and don't support early returns directly. So I need a way to stop processing once the first duplicate is found. Hmm, perhaps using an If condition within the loop to break out early if a duplicate is found.\n\nAlternatively, since we're using a For loop which processes each item in sequence, as soon as a duplicate is found, we can set the output and then trigger the continue event to exit the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Strings.Characters on the input string to get a list of characters.\n- Use List.Empty to create an empty list for seen characters.\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each character in the characters list.\n- For each iteration, check if the current character is in the seen list using List.Contains.\n- If it is, set the output property and trigger continue.\n- If not, add the current character to the seen list.\n\nBut how do I modify the seen list within the loop? Since List.Add creates a new list, I can use a setter to update the seen list each time a new character is added.\n\nSo, here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Convert the input string into a list of characters using Strings.Characters.\n2. Initialize an empty list for seen characters using List.Empty.\n3. Use Std.For to loop over each character in the characters list.\n4. For each character:\n   a. Check if it exists in the seen list using List.Contains.\n   b. If it does, set the output property to this character and trigger continue.\n   c. If not, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut wait, how do I pass the current character to the List.Contains check? The For loop's onItem event gives access to the item being processed, so in the function, I can connect that to the List.Contains input.\n\nAlso, each time a new character is added to the seen list, I need to update the setter so that subsequent iterations have the updated list.\n\nLet me think about the node connections:\n\n- The output of Strings.Characters goes into Std.For.items.\n- The seen list starts as empty from List.Empty.\n- For each item (character) in Std.For.items:\n   - Connect to List.Contains.left.\n   - The seen list is connected to List.Contains.right.\n   - If List.Contains.result is true, then we have a duplicate; set the output and continue.\n   - Else, add the character to the seen list using List.Add.\n\nBut how do I trigger this for each item? Maybe using an Iteration.Map inside the For loop to process each item with a handler that performs the check and updates the seen list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a function within the For loop's onItem event to handle each character.\n\nWait, Midio allows functions to be defined inline. So, I can create a sub-function within the main function that processes each character.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nfunc first_repeated_char {\n    in execute trigger\n    in string property (String)\n    out continue trigger\n    out char property (Any)\n\n    \n    strings_characters = Strings.Characters(string)\n\n    \n    seen_list = List.Empty()\n\n    \n    for_each_char in Std.For(strings_characters) {\n        current_char = for_each_char.item\n\n        \n        contains = List.Contains(seen_list, current_char)\n\n        if contains {\n            char = current_char\n            continue\n        } else {\n            seen_list = List"
