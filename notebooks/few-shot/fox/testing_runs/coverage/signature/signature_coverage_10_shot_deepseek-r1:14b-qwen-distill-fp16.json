                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will finish. So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items. But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, maybe after setting both, I can trigger a continue event to exit.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will end naturally. So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

Use IfExpression nodes to determine which case we're in and update the respective variables accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to maintain state across iterations in Midio. Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, we can set some flag that stops further processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nYes, that's another approach: use Query.Filter with where \"it % 2 == 0\" to get all evens, then take the first item. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- Filter the list to get all even numbers.\n- Take the first element from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and more efficient in terms of code structure.\n\nOnce I have both first_even and first_odd, subtract them to get the difference.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number. So we don't need to handle those edge cases unless specified.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n   - Use Query.Filter",

So maybe after finding both, I can trigger a reset to exit early? Or perhaps it's easier to just process all items but only set the first occurrences.\n\nAnother thought: since I need the first even and first odd, their positions might not be in order. The first even could come before or after the first odd. So I have to check each item in sequence until both are found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to determine if it's even or odd.\n- When an even is found and first_even isn't set yet, set first_even.\n- Similarly for odd.\n- Once both are set, compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use multiple IfExpression nodes within the loop. But Midio doesn't allow nesting functions in that way. So perhaps I can chain the IfExpressions or use a combination of triggers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a single IfExpression with conditions to check for even and odd, and update the respective properties accordingly.\n\nWait, another approach: since I'm only interested in the first occurrences, I can process each item in order and set the properties as soon as they are found. Once both are found, any subsequent items can be ignored.\n\nBut how do I ignore them? Maybe by using a condition to check if both are already set before processing further.\n\nHmm, perhaps after setting first_even or first_odd, I can have conditions that skip further checks once both are found.\n\nAlternatively, since the For loop will process all items regardless, but I can just not update the properties once they're set. That way, even if more evens or odds come later, they won't overwrite the first ones.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Initialize first_even and first_odd as null.\n- Iterate through each item:\n   - If item is even and first_even is null: set first_even = item\n   - Else if item is odd and first_odd is null: set first_odd = item\n- After all items are processed, compute difference.\n\nBut wait, this approach would require processing the entire list, which might not be efficient. However, for simplicity, it's manageable.\n\nSo in Midio terms:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, use IfExpression to check if the item is even or odd.\n3. Update first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n4. After the loop completes, compute the difference between first_even and first_odd.\n\nBut how do I handle the computation after the loop? Maybe using a Math.Sub node that subtracts first_odd from first_even.\n\nWait, but in Midio, properties are set based on triggers. So perhaps after the For loop has processed all items, I can trigger a node to compute the difference.\n\nAlternatively, since the For loop's done event is triggered when it finishes processing all items, I can connect that to a Math.Sub node that calculates the difference.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Create two properties: first_even and first_odd.\n- Use a For loop on the input list. Connect each item to an IfExpression to check if even or odd.\n- When an even is found (and first_even is null), set it using a setter.\n- Similarly for odd.\n- Once all items are processed",

But that might not be efficient if the list is large, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, process each item in a single pass:\n\n- For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and first_even hasn't been set yet, set it.\n- If it's odd and first_odd hasn't been set yet, set it.\n- Once both are found, break out of the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have a way to break out of loops early. So I might need to find another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop with an index. Once both first_even and first_odd are found, I can stop processing further items by not connecting the next trigger after that point.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n- Keep track of whether first_even and first_odd have been found yet.\n- Once both are found, don't process further items by not connecting the next trigger.\n\nBut how to manage state in Midio? Maybe using properties to store whether we've found them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use two separate For loops: one to find the first even and another to find the first odd. But that might require processing the list twice, which isn't efficient but could be manageable for simplicity.\n\nWait, let's think about how to structure this with Midio nodes:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list.\n2. For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even or odd.\n3. Keep track of whether we've found the first even and first odd.\n4. Once both are found, compute their difference.\n\nBut since Midio doesn't support state variables directly, I might need to use some properties or functions that can hold these states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map to process each item and update the necessary variables.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to split the problem into two parts:\n\na. Find the first even number in the list.\nb. Find the first odd number in the list.\nc. Subtract them.\n\nSo, for part a: Use a For loop on the list, check each item with IfExpression (n % 2 == 0), and when found, store it as first_even. Then break out of the loop.\n\nSimilarly for part b: Do the same to find first_odd.\n\nBut again, Midio doesn't support breaking early, so I might need to process all items unless there's a way to stop processing after finding both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use two separate For loops:\n\n- The first loop finds the first even.\n- The second loop finds the first odd.\n\nBut this would require iterating through the list twice. If the list is large, it's not efficient, but for simplicity, maybe acceptable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Find first_even:\n   - Iterate through each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if even using IfExpression.\n   - When found, store it and stop processing further items (but Midio doesn't support stopping early, so perhaps just take the first occurrence from the loop).\n\n2. Similarly for first_odd.\n\nBut how to get the first occurrence? Maybe by using a List.FirstItem function or similar.\n\nWait, Midio has a List.FirstItem node that returns the first item of a list. But I need the first even and first odd, which might not be the same as the overall first item.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use Query.Filter to get all even numbers in the list.\n- Then take the first item from this filtered list using List.FirstItem.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n2. Take the first item from this filtered list as first_even.\n3. Similarly, filter the input list to get all odd numbers.\n4. Take the first item from this filtered list as first_odd.\n5. Compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The function might need to handle that",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of Map and Filter functions. Alternatively, maybe using a custom handler within an Iteration.Map to process each item and update the first_even and first_odd as needed.\n\nWait, another idea: iterate through the list with For, and for each item, check if it's even or odd. Use IfExpression nodes to determine which case we're in and update the respective variables accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to maintain state across iterations in Midio. Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, we can set some flag that stops further processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nYes, that's another approach: use Query.Filter with where \"it % 2 == 0\" to get all evens, then take the first item. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- Filter the list to get all even numbers.\n- Take the first element from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and more efficient in terms of code structure.\n\nOnce I have both first_even and first_odd, subtract them to get the difference.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number. So we don't need to handle those edge cases unless specified.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n   - Use Query.Filter",

Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will finish. So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items. But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, maybe after setting both, I can trigger a continue event to exit.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will end naturally. So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of Map and Filter functions. Alternatively, maybe using a custom handler within an Iteration.Map to process each item and update the first_even and first_odd as needed.\n\nWait, another idea: since I need both the first even and the first odd, perhaps I can iterate through the list twice\u2014once to find the first even and once to find the first odd. But that might not be efficient if the list is large, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nAlternatively, process each item in a single pass:\n\n- For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and first_even hasn't been set yet, set it.\n- If it's odd and first_odd hasn't been set yet, set it.\n- Once both are found, break out of the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have a way to break out of loops early. So I might need to find another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop with an index. Once both first_even and first_odd are found, I can stop processing further items by not connecting the next trigger after that point.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n- Keep track of whether first_even and first_odd have been found yet.\n- Once both are found, don't process further items by not connecting the next trigger.\n\nBut how to manage state in Midio? Maybe using properties to store whether we've found them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use two separate For loops: one to find the first even and another to find the first odd. But that might require processing the list twice, which isn't efficient but could be manageable for simplicity.\n\nWait, let's think about how to structure this with Midio nodes:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list.\n2. For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even or odd.\n3. Keep track of whether we've found the first even and first odd.\n4. Once both are found, compute their difference.\n\nBut since Midio doesn't support state variables directly, I might need to use some properties or functions that can hold these states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map to process each item and update the necessary variables.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to split the problem into two parts:\n\na. Find the first even number in the list.\nb. Find the first odd number in the list.\nc. Subtract them.\n\nSo, for part a: Use a For loop on the list, check each item with IfExpression (n % 2 == 0), and when found, store it as first_even. Then break out of the loop.\n\nSimilarly for part b: Do the same to find first_odd.\n\nBut again, Midio doesn't support breaking early, so I might need to process all items unless there's a way to stop processing after finding both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use two separate For loops:\n\n- The first loop finds the first even.\n- The second loop finds the first odd.\n\nBut this would require iterating through the list twice. If the list is large, it's not efficient, but for simplicity, maybe acceptable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n1. Find first_even:\n   - Iterate through each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if even using IfExpression.\n   - When found, store it and stop processing further items (but Midio doesn't support stopping early, so perhaps just take the first occurrence from the loop).\n\n2. Similarly for first_odd.\n\nBut how to get the first occurrence? Maybe by using a List.FirstItem function or similar.\n\nWait, Midio has a List.FirstItem node that returns the first item of a list. But I need the first even and first odd, which might not be the same as the overall first item.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Use Query.Filter to get all even numbers in the list.\n- Then take the first item from this filtered list using List.FirstItem.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n2. Take the first item from this filtered list as first_even.\n3. Similarly, filter the input list to get all odd numbers.\n4. Take the first item from this filtered list as first_odd.\n5. Compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The function might need to handle that",

Use IfExpression nodes to determine which case we're in and update the respective variables accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to maintain state across iterations in Midio. Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, we can set some flag that stops further processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nYes, that's another approach: use Query.Filter with where \"it % 2 == 0\" to get all evens, then take the first item. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- Filter the list to get all even numbers.\n- Take the first element from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and more efficient in terms of code structure.\n\nOnce I have both first_even and first_odd, subtract them to get the difference.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number. So we don't need to handle those edge cases unless specified.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n   - Use Query.Filter"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values.

Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can't be directly referenced like this in expressions unless they are passed as parameters. So I need to ensure that the expressions correctly reference the input 'n'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each step sequentially using Math nodes.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the sum is n*(n+1)/2 and average is (n+1)/2, maybe I can compute both directly without generating the list. That would be more efficient.\n\nSo, for sum:\n\nsum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\naverage = sum / n = (n + 1) / 2\n\nThis simplifies things because I don't need to generate the list at all. I can compute both values directly using Math.Expression nodes.\n\nThat's a better approach as it avoids unnecessary steps and is more efficient, especially for large n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n- The first expression will be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- The second expression will be \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n\nThen, combine these two results into a single output. Since the output is of type Any, I can create a list containing both values.\n\nTo create a list with sum and average, I'll use List.Add twice:\n\nFirst, add the sum to an empty list, then add the average to that list.\n\nAlternatively, since List.GenerateRange isn't needed anymore, perhaps just compute each value and combine them into a list.\n\nWait, but how do I structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n1. An instance of Math.Expression for sum.\n2. Another instance of Math.Expression for average.\n3. Use List.Add to create a list starting with sum, then add average to it.\n\nBut since List.Add returns a new list each time, I can chain them together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to 0 (but that doesn't make sense). Or maybe just create an empty list and add both values.\n\nWait, no. Since the output is a single Any type, which can hold a list or an object, I'll proceed by creating a list with two elements: sum and average.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\n- Create an empty list using List.Empty.\n- Add sum to this list, resulting in [sum].\n- Then add average to this new list, resulting in [sum, average].\n\nBut wait, each call to List.Add creates a new list. So first, I have an empty list. After adding sum, it becomes [sum]. Then, adding average would create [sum, average].\n\nSo, the code will involve:\n\n- An empty list.\n- Add sum to it.\n- Then add average to that.\n\nBut in Midio, each List.Add is a separate node, so I'll need two List.Add instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n, but since we're not using the actual numbers, just their count and properties, it's more efficient to compute directly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Input 'n' is provided.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with expression \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Compute average using Math.Expression with expression \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n- Create an empty list.\n- Add sum to the empty list, resulting",

Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions?

Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with n as input.\n- Then, compute average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nBut how do I pass both values into the average calculation? Maybe use a function node that takes two inputs: sum and n.\n\nAlternatively, create another Math.Expression for average where the expression is \"sum / n\", but then I need to provide both sum and n as inputs to this node.\n\nWait, perhaps each Math.Expression can have multiple inputs. For example, in the first Math.Expression for sum, I pass n as x, and in the second, I pass sum as a and n as b, with expression \"a / b\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create the list from 1 to n. But actually, since we're using the formula, maybe this isn't necessary. We can directly compute the sum without generating the list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I don't need to generate the list at all. Since the sum of first n natural numbers is known",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can create a list with two elements: [sum, average].\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows for more complex structures, maybe an object like { sum: ..., average: ... }, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at previous examples, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange and then Iteration.Map to apply operations. But in this case, since the formula is known, using Math.Expression is more efficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Create a node for List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2.

It might require that all necessary values are passed as parameters to the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use a single Math.Expression node with both sum and average computed in one go, but that could complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: since the formula for average is (n+1)/2, because average = sum / n = [n(n+1)/2] / n = (n+1)/2. So perhaps compute average directly as (n + 1) / 2.\n\nThat might simplify things. So:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(x * (x + 1))",

The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can create a list with two elements: [sum, average].\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows for more complex structures, maybe an object like { sum: ..., average: ... }, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at previous examples, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange and then Iteration.Map to apply operations. But in this case, since the formula is known, using Math.Expression is more efficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Create a node for List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions? Each Math.Expression needs its inputs. So perhaps:\n\n- For sum: use a Math.Expression where the expression is \"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", and provide x as n.\n- For average: use another Math.Expression with expression \"sum / x\", providing both sum and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows using variables from other nodes in expressions. Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with n as input.\n- Then, compute average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nBut how do I pass both values into the average calculation? Maybe use a function node that takes two inputs: sum and n.\n\nAlternatively, create another Math.Expression for average where the expression is \"sum / n\", but then I need to provide both sum and n as inputs to this node.\n\nWait, perhaps each Math.Expression can have multiple inputs. For example, in the first Math.Expression for sum, I pass n as x, and in the second, I pass sum as a and n as b, with expression \"a / b\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create the list from 1 to n. But actually, since we're using the formula, maybe this isn't necessary. We can directly compute the sum without generating the list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I don't need to generate the list at all. Since the sum of first n natural numbers is known",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will only find one item. So I can connect their 'item' outputs to the multiplication function.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are connected via triggers and properties. Let me think about how to wire this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Map or Filter isn't necessary here since we just need the first occurrence of each.\n\nWait, another approach: use List.FirstItem for both even and odd. But FirstItem only gives the first item in the list, not based on a condition. So that won't work directly.\n\nSo back to Iteration.Find. Each Find node can be configured with a predicate function (using IfExpression) to check if the item is even or odd.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an instance of Iteration.Find.\n   - The handler function for this Find will return true when the item is even.\n   \n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two items obtained from the Find nodes.\n\nBut how do I connect these in Midio? Each Find node will have an 'item' output that can be connected to the multiplication function.\n\nWait, but each Find is a separate process. So perhaps I need to chain them or use some kind of variable storage to hold the first even and odd numbers until both are found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to iterate through the list once, keeping track of whether we've found an even and/or odd number yet.\n\nThis might require using variables to store the first even and first odd as they're encountered. Then, after processing all elements, multiply them if both exist.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have a built-in variable storage node, so I'd need to use some workaround, perhaps by using List.FirstItem or other functions creatively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n- **First Pass (Find Even)**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - Store the result in a variable or directly use it.\n\n- **Second Pass (Find Odd)**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find on the same list, but looking for odd numbers.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Each Find would process the entire list until it finds its target.\n\nWait, perhaps I can connect both Find nodes to the same list and let them each find their respective items independently.\n\nOnce both have found their items, multiply them together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first with predicate \"it % 2 == 0\".\n   - The second with predicate \"it % 2 != 0\".\n\n- Connect the 'item' outputs of both Find nodes to Math.Mul's inputs.\n\nBut wait, Midio functions typically take inputs and produce outputs. So perhaps I need to connect them in a way that after both have their items, they are passed to the multiplication function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use two separate variables to store each found item and then multiply them.\n\nBut since Midio doesn't support variables directly, perhaps using List.FirstItem or other functions isn't feasible here.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a single For loop to iterate through the list once. For each item, check if it's even or odd, and if we haven't found one yet, store it. Once both are found, break out of the loop and compute the product.\n\nBut implementing this in Midio would require more complex logic with conditions and possibly multiple triggers.\n\nLet me outline how to do that:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create two variables: firstEven and first",

So I need to create two separate Find instances: one for even and one for odd.\n\nWait, no. The list is processed once by each Find, but since they are separate nodes, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- Each Find node has its own predicate (even or odd).\n- Capture their outputs.\n- Multiply them.\n\nBut how do I handle cases where there might be no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that each exists, so we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, let me think about the Midio code structure.\n\nI'll start by creating two Find nodes. Each will take the list as input and have a predicate function.\n\nFor the first Find (even):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n\nFor the second Find (odd):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n\nOnce both items are found, multiply them using Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node returns the item through its 'item' output. So I can connect these to variables and then use them in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can chain the operations: first find even, then find odd, then multiply.\n\nBut since both finds are independent, maybe it's better to process them in parallel or sequentially.\n\nWait, but Midio processes nodes in a flow. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after finding both items, their values are available for multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a Map function to find the first even and odd, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Use two separate For loops, each iterating through the list once to find the first even and odd. But that would process the list twice, which is acceptable since it's manageable.\n\nBut using Find seems more efficient as it stops at the first occurrence.\n\nSo, let me outline the code:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The function has an input 'list' property of type List.\n   - Output is a number.\n\n2. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an Iteration.Find node.\n   - Connect the list to its 'items' input.\n   - Set the predicate to check if item % 2 == 0.\n   - Capture the found item as even_num.\n\n3. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find node.\n   - Same list connected.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0.\n   - Capture as odd_num.\n\n4. **Multiply**:\n   - Use Math.Mul with even_num and odd_num.\n   - Output the result.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I connect these? Each Find node will have its own 'item' output which can be connected to variables or directly used in the multiplication.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function call is a separate execution. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after both items are found, their values are passed to the multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, since the Find nodes are independent, maybe I can connect them in parallel and then combine their outputs.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Maybe using a Combine or Zip function?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the list once with a custom handler that tracks both first even and odd numbers. But that would require more complex logic within a single Map or For loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can use two separate Find nodes and then multiply their results.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n- Create two Find instances: find_even and find_odd.\n- Both take the input list.\n- Each has its own predicate.\n- The outputs of these finds are connected to variables even_num and odd_num.\n- Then, connect these variables to a Math.Mul node which produces the output.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I capture the outputs of Find nodes? They have an 'item' output property. So perhaps:\n\n- find_even.item -> even_num\n- find_odd.item -> odd_num\n\nThen, even_num and odd_num are connected as inputs to Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each node can only be executed once per function call. So if I use two Find nodes on the same list, they will both process the entire list until their respective conditions are met.\n\nBut that's acceptable since it's a small overhead for most lists.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The input list",

So I need to connect the found items from both Find nodes into a single multiplication operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use variables to store the first even and odd numbers as they are found during iteration.\n\nHmm, maybe using a For loop would be better here because it allows me to process each item step by step and keep track of whether I've found an even or odd number yet.\n\nLet's consider using a For loop:\n\n- Initialize two variables: first_even and first_odd, both set to null.\n- Iterate through each item in the list:\n   - If the current item is even and first_even is null, assign it to first_even.\n   - If the current item is odd and first_odd is null, assign it to first_odd.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, we can use setters and getters to manage state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate For loops: one for even and one for odd, but that might not be efficient as it would process the list twice.\n\nWait, maybe I can first find the first even number, then with the remaining elements, find the first odd. But that's still processing the list in parts.\n\nAlternatively, use a single For loop to iterate through each element once, checking for both conditions and storing the first occurrences.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the list.\n- For each item:\n   - If it's even and no even found yet, store it as first_even.\n   - If it's odd and no odd found yet, store it as first_odd.\n   - Once both are found, perhaps break early? But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, we can just continue until the end.\n\nBut how to manage state in Midio. Maybe using a context variable that keeps track of which ones have been found.\n\nWait, I think the Iteration.Map function can be used to process each item and keep track of first_even and first_odd by updating some variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use two separate Find nodes on the same list, one for even and one for odd. But how does that work?\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate checking if item is even.\n   - The found item is stored in a variable.\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list (or remaining elements?).\n\nBut wait, after finding the first even, do I need to skip it when looking for odd? No, because the first odd could be before or after the first even in the list.\n\nWait no, because if I process the entire list again with Find for odd, it will find the first occurrence regardless of where the even was found. So that's acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two separate Iteration.Find nodes on the same input list.\n   - The first finds the first even.\n   - The second finds the first odd.\n- Then multiply them using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how to connect these in Midio.\n\nWait, each Find node will have an 'item' output property that gives the found item. So I can connect both items to a multiplication function.\n\nLet me outline this:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find:\n   - find_even: predicate is \"it % 2 == 0\"\n   - find_odd: predicate is \"it % 2 != 0\"\n\n- Connect list -> find_even.items and list -> find_odd.items\n\n- Then, take the 'item' from both finds and",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node can only be used once per function call. So I need to create two separate Find instances: one for even and one for odd.\n\nWait, no. The list is processed once by each Find, but since they are separate nodes, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- Each Find node has its own predicate (even or odd).\n- Capture their outputs.\n- Multiply them.\n\nBut how do I handle cases where there might be no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that each exists, so we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, let me think about the Midio code structure.\n\nI'll start by creating two Find nodes.

So I can connect these to variables and then use them in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can chain the operations: first find even, then find odd, then multiply.\n\nBut since both finds are independent, maybe it's better to process them in parallel or sequentially.\n\nWait, but Midio processes nodes in a flow.

Maybe using a Combine or Zip function?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the list once with a custom handler that tracks both first even and odd numbers.

Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node needs a handler function. So I'll need to create predicate functions for each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using IfExpression within the Find handlers can help determine if an item is even or odd.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n1. **First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - The handler for Find will be a function that returns true when the item is even.\n\n2. **First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\nBut in Midio, each Find node can only find one item, so I need to process the list twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single loop and tracking both first even and first odd as I go through the list would be more efficient. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice. But for the sake of simplicity and given that the problem doesn't specify performance constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **Input List**: Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- **Find Even**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- **Find Odd**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- **Multiply Results**: Take the outputs from both Find nodes and multiply them.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node returns a single item. So I can connect these two items to a Math.Mul node.\n\nNow, let me think about how to implement this in code:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n2. Create another instance of Iteration.Find for odd numbers.\n3. Connect the list input to both Find nodes.\n4. For each Find node, set up a predicate function using IfExpression or similar.\n5. Take the outputs from both Find nodes and connect them to Math.Mul.\n6. The result of Math.Mul is the output.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, functions are triggered based on events. So I need to ensure that both Find operations complete before proceeding to multiply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a For loop to iterate through each element once, keeping track of the first even and odd encountered.\n\nLet me think about this approach:\n\n- Use a single For loop over the list.\n- Initialize variables for first_even and first_odd as null or undefined.\n- As each item is processed:\n   - If it's even and first_even hasn't been found yet, set first_even to this item.\n   - If it's odd and first_odd hasn't been found yet, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming languages. So I need to find a way to track these states using available nodes.\n\nThis might be more complex but could be more efficient as it processes the list only once.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. **Initialize State Variables**:\n   - first_even: null\n   - first_odd: null\n\n2. **For Loop**:\n   - Iterate over each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Continue until both are found.\n\n3. **Multiply**:\n   - Once the loop completes,",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required.

So I need to create two separate Find instances: one for even and one for odd.\n\nWait, no. The list is processed once by each Find, but since they are separate nodes, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- Each Find node has its own predicate (even or odd).\n- Capture their outputs.\n- Multiply them.\n\nBut how do I handle cases where there might be no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that each exists, so we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, let me think about the Midio code structure.\n\nI'll start by creating two Find nodes. Each will take the list as input and have a predicate function.\n\nFor the first Find (even):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n\nFor the second Find (odd):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n\nOnce both items are found, multiply them using Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node returns the item through its 'item' output. So I can connect these to variables and then use them in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can chain the operations: first find even, then find odd, then multiply.\n\nBut since both finds are independent, maybe it's better to process them in parallel or sequentially.\n\nWait, but Midio processes nodes in a flow. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after finding both items, their values are available for multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a Map function to find the first even and odd, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Use two separate For loops, each iterating through the list once to find the first even and odd. But that would process the list twice, which is acceptable since it's manageable.\n\nBut using Find seems more efficient as it stops at the first occurrence.\n\nSo, let me outline the code:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The function has an input 'list' property of type List.\n   - Output is a number.\n\n2. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an Iteration.Find node.\n   - Connect the list to its 'items' input.\n   - Set the predicate to check if item % 2 == 0.\n   - Capture the found item as even_num.\n\n3. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find node.\n   - Same list connected.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0.\n   - Capture as odd_num.\n\n4. **Multiply**:\n   - Use Math.Mul with even_num and odd_num.\n   - Output the result.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I connect these? Each Find node will have its own 'item' output which can be connected to variables or directly used in the multiplication.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function call is a separate execution. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after both items are found, their values are passed to the multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, since the Find nodes are independent, maybe I can connect them in parallel and then combine their outputs.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Maybe using a Combine or Zip function?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the list once with a custom handler that tracks both first even and odd numbers. But that would require more complex logic within a single Map or For loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can use two separate Find nodes and then multiply their results.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n- Create two Find instances: find_even and find_odd.\n- Both take the input list.\n- Each has its own predicate.\n- The outputs of these finds are connected to variables even_num and odd_num.\n- Then, connect these variables to a Math.Mul node which produces the output.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I capture the outputs of Find nodes? They have an 'item' output property. So perhaps:\n\n- find_even.item -> even_num\n- find_odd.item -> odd_num\n\nThen, even_num and odd_num are connected as inputs to Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each node can only be executed once per function call. So if I use two Find nodes on the same list, they will both process the entire list until their respective conditions are met.\n\nBut that's acceptable since it's a small overhead for most lists.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The input list",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will finish. So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items. But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, maybe after setting both, I can trigger a continue event to exit.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will end naturally. So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, we can set some flag that stops further processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nYes, that's another approach: use Query.Filter with where \"it % 2 == 0\" to get all evens, then take the first item. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- Filter the list to get all even numbers.\n- Take the first element from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Do the same for odd numbers.\n\nThis approach is cleaner and more efficient in terms of code structure.\n\nOnce I have both first_even and first_odd, subtract them to get the difference.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers in the list? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number. So we don't need to handle those edge cases unless specified.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio:\n\n1. Filter the input list to get all even numbers.\n   - Use Query.Filter",

So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will finish. So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items. But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, maybe after setting both, I can trigger a continue event to exit.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will end naturally. So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere.

Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, set a flag that tells subsequent iterations to stop processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nWait, another approach: Use List.FirstItem on the filtered list of evens and odds.\n\nYes! That's a better idea. Because if I can filter the list to get only even numbers, then take the first item, that gives me the first_even. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- For first_even:\n   - Filter the list where each item is even.\n   - Take the first item from this filtered list.\n- For first_odd:\n   - Filter the list where each item is odd.\n   - Take the first item from this filtered list.\n\nThen, compute their difference.\n\nThis approach uses two separate filters and first items. It's straightforward and leverages Midio's built-in functions effectively.\n\nSo, let me structure the code accordingly:\n\n1. Use Query.Filter on the input list to get all even numbers.\n2. Use List.FirstItem on this filtered list to get first_even.",

So I might need to find another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using a For loop with an index.

Maybe using properties to store whether we've found them yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use two separate filters: one to find the first even and another to find the first odd. Then, subtract these two values.\n\nWait, but that would require processing the list twice, which might not be efficient, but for simplicity, it could work.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. Use a Query.Filter to get all even numbers from the list.\n2. Take the first item of this filtered list as first_even.\n3. Similarly, use another Query.Filter to get all odd numbers and take the first as first_odd.\n4. Subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut wait, what if the list doesn't contain any even or odd numbers? The function might return null or cause an error. But perhaps the task assumes that there is at least one even and one odd number in the list.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, in Midio code:\n\n- Create a filter for even numbers where it % 2 == 0.\n- Get the first item from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Similarly, create another filter for odd numbers where it % 2 != 0.\n- Get the first item from this filtered list as first_odd.\n- Subtract first_odd from first_even to get the difference.\n\nBut how do I get the first item of a list in Midio? There's a List.FirstItem function that can be used.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Use Query.Filter with where: \"it % 2 == 0\" on the input list to get even_numbers.\n2. Use List.FirstItem on even_numbers to get first_even.\n3. Use Query.Filter with where: \"it % 2 != 0\" on the input list to get odd_numbers.\n4. Use List.FirstItem on odd_numbers to get first_odd.\n5. Subtract first_odd from first_even using Math.Sub.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are connected via their outputs and inputs. So I need to chain these nodes appropriately.\n\nLet me outline the steps with node connections:\n\n- Input list -> even_filter (Query.Filter where it is even)\n- even_filter.result -> even_first_item (List.FirstItem) -> first_even\n- input list -> odd_filter (Query.Filter where it is odd)\n- odd_filter.result -> odd_first_item (List.FirstItem) -> first_odd\n- Then, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut wait, the output of List.FirstItem is a property that holds the item. So I can connect these properties to Math.Sub's inputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use an Iteration.Map to process each element and track the first even and odd.\n\nBut considering time constraints, using two separate filters might be simpler.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed in sequence, so I need to make sure that both first_even and first_odd are computed before performing the subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a single pass with a custom handler within an Iteration.Map.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"sum / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can't be directly referenced like this in expressions unless they are passed as parameters. So I need to ensure that the expressions correctly reference the input 'n'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each step sequentially using Math nodes.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the sum is n*(n+1)/2 and average is (n+1)/2, maybe I can compute both directly without generating the list. That would be more efficient.\n\nSo, for sum:\n\nsum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\naverage = sum / n = (n + 1) / 2\n\nThis simplifies things because I don't need to generate the list at all. I can compute both values directly using Math.Expression nodes.\n\nThat's a better approach as it avoids unnecessary steps and is more efficient, especially for large n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n- The first expression will be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- The second expression will be \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n\nThen, combine these two results into a single output. Since the output is of type Any, I can create a list containing both values.\n\nTo create a list with sum and average, I'll use List.Add twice:\n\nFirst, add the sum to an empty list, then add the average to that list.\n\nAlternatively, since List.GenerateRange isn't needed anymore, perhaps just compute each value and combine them into a list.\n\nWait, but how do I structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n1. An instance of Math.Expression for sum.\n2. Another instance of Math.Expression for average.\n3. Use List.Add to create a list starting with sum, then add average to it.\n\nBut since List.Add returns a new list each time, I can chain them together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to 0 (but that doesn't make sense). Or maybe just create an empty list and add both values.\n\nWait, no. Since the output is a single Any type, which can hold a list or an object, I'll proceed by creating a list with two elements: sum and average.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\n- Create an empty list using List.Empty.\n- Add sum to this list, resulting in [sum].\n- Then add average to this new list, resulting in [sum, average].\n\nBut wait, each call to List.Add creates a new list. So first, I have an empty list. After adding sum, it becomes [sum]. Then, adding average would create [sum, average].\n\nSo, the code will involve:\n\n- An empty list.\n- Add sum to it.\n- Then add average to that.\n\nBut in Midio, each List.Add is a separate node, so I'll need two List.Add instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n, but since we're not using the actual numbers, just their count and properties, it's more efficient to compute directly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Input 'n' is provided.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with expression \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Compute average using Math.Expression with expression \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n- Create an empty list.\n- Add sum to the empty list, resulting",

Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any.

Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections.

It might require that all necessary values are passed as parameters to the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use a single Math.Expression node with both sum and average computed in one go, but that could complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: since the formula for average is (n+1)/2, because average = sum / n = [n(n+1)/2] / n = (n+1)/2.

Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can create a list with two elements: [sum, average].\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows for more complex structures, maybe an object like { sum: ..., average: ... }, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at previous examples, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange and then Iteration.Map to apply operations. But in this case, since the formula is known, using Math.Expression is more efficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Create a node for List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions? Each Math.Expression needs its inputs. So perhaps:\n\n- For sum: use a Math.Expression where the expression is \"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", and provide x as n.\n- For average: use another Math.Expression with expression \"sum / x\", providing both sum and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows using variables from other nodes in expressions. Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with n as input.\n- Then, compute average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nBut how do I pass both values into the average calculation? Maybe use a function node that takes two inputs: sum and n.\n\nAlternatively, create another Math.Expression for average where the expression is \"sum / n\", but then I need to provide both sum and n as inputs to this node.\n\nWait, perhaps each Math.Expression can have multiple inputs. For example, in the first Math.Expression for sum, I pass n as x, and in the second, I pass sum as a and n as b, with expression \"a / b\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create the list from 1 to n. But actually, since we're using the formula, maybe this isn't necessary. We can directly compute the sum without generating the list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I don't need to generate the list at all. Since the sum of first n natural numbers is known",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers.

Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\".

Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions? Each Math.Expression needs its inputs. So perhaps:\n\n- For sum: use a Math.Expression where the expression is \"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", and provide x as n.\n- For average: use another Math.Expression with expression \"sum / x\", providing both sum and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows using variables from other nodes in expressions. Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with n as input.\n- Then, compute average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nBut how do I pass both values into the average calculation? Maybe use a function node that takes two inputs: sum and n.\n\nAlternatively, create another Math.Expression for average where the expression is \"sum / n\", but then I need to provide both sum and n as inputs to this node.\n\nWait, perhaps each Math.Expression can have multiple inputs. For example, in the first Math.Expression for sum, I pass n as x, and in the second, I pass sum as a and n as b, with expression \"a / b\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create the list from 1 to n. But actually, since we're using the formula, maybe this isn't necessary. We can directly compute the sum without generating the list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I don't need to generate the list at all. Since the sum of first n natural numbers is known",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that.

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will only find one item. So I can connect their 'item' outputs to the multiplication function.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are connected via triggers and properties. Let me think about how to wire this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Map or Filter isn't necessary here since we just need the first occurrence of each.\n\nWait, another approach: use List.FirstItem for both even and odd. But FirstItem only gives the first item in the list, not based on a condition. So that won't work directly.\n\nSo back to Iteration.Find. Each Find node can be configured with a predicate function (using IfExpression) to check if the item is even or odd.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an instance of Iteration.Find.\n   - The handler function for this Find will return true when the item is even.\n   \n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two items obtained from the Find nodes.\n\nBut how do I connect these in Midio? Each Find node will have an 'item' output that can be connected to the multiplication function.\n\nWait, but each Find is a separate process. So perhaps I need to chain them or use some kind of variable storage to hold the first even and odd numbers until both are found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to iterate through the list once, keeping track of whether we've found an even and/or odd number yet.\n\nThis might require using variables to store the first even and first odd as they're encountered. Then, after processing all elements, multiply them if both exist.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have a built-in variable storage node, so I'd need to use some workaround, perhaps by using List.FirstItem or other functions creatively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n- **First Pass (Find Even)**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - Store the result in a variable or directly use it.\n\n- **Second Pass (Find Odd)**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find on the same list, but looking for odd numbers.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Each Find would process the entire list until it finds its target.\n\nWait, perhaps I can connect both Find nodes to the same list and let them each find their respective items independently.\n\nOnce both have found their items, multiply them together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first with predicate \"it % 2 == 0\".\n   - The second with predicate \"it % 2 != 0\".\n\n- Connect the 'item' outputs of both Find nodes to Math.Mul's inputs.\n\nBut wait, Midio functions typically take inputs and produce outputs. So perhaps I need to connect them in a way that after both have their items, they are passed to the multiplication function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use two separate variables to store each found item and then multiply them.\n\nBut since Midio doesn't support variables directly, perhaps using List.FirstItem or other functions isn't feasible here.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a single For loop to iterate through the list once. For each item, check if it's even or odd, and if we haven't found one yet, store it. Once both are found, break out of the loop and compute the product.\n\nBut implementing this in Midio would require more complex logic with conditions and possibly multiple triggers.\n\nLet me outline how to do that:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create two variables: firstEven and first",

But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice. But for the sake of simplicity and given that the problem doesn't specify performance constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **Input List**: Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- **Find Even**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- **Find Odd**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- **Multiply Results**: Take the outputs from both Find nodes and multiply them.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node returns a single item. So I can connect these two items to a Math.Mul node.\n\nNow, let me think about how to implement this in code:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n2.

Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So I'll need to create predicate functions for each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using IfExpression within the Find handlers can help determine if an item is even or odd.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n1. **First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - The handler for Find will be a function that returns true when the item is even.\n\n2. **First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\nBut in Midio, each Find node can only find one item, so I need to process the list twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single loop and tracking both first even and first odd as I go through the list would be more efficient. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice.

So I need to connect the found items from both Find nodes into a single multiplication operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use variables to store the first even and odd numbers as they are found during iteration.\n\nHmm, maybe using a For loop would be better here because it allows me to process each item step by step and keep track of whether I've found an even or odd number yet.\n\nLet's consider using a For loop:\n\n- Initialize two variables: first_even and first_odd, both set to null.\n- Iterate through each item in the list:\n   - If the current item is even and first_even is null, assign it to first_even.\n   - If the current item is odd and first_odd is null, assign it to first_odd.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense.

Maybe sticking with two Find nodes is simpler, even if it processes the list twice.\n\nBut wait, what if the list has multiple evens and odds? The first occurrence is all we need.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n1. Use Iteration.Find for the first even.\n2. Use another Iteration.Find for the first odd.\n3.

Each Find node has an 'item' output property when it finds something. So:\n\nfind_even.item -> mul.input1\nfind_odd.item -> mul.input2\n\nWait, but in Midio, each node can only have one input and one output. Or perhaps I need to connect them appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a variable to store the first even and another for the first odd, then multiply them.\n\nBut without variables, this might be tricky.\n\nAnother approach: Use two separate For loops, each finding their respective numbers, and then multiply.\n\nWait, but that would require processing the list twice.

The problem statement probably assumes that each exists, so we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, let me think about the Midio code structure.\n\nI'll start by creating two Find nodes.

So I can connect these to variables and then use them in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can chain the operations: first find even, then find odd, then multiply.\n\nBut since both finds are independent, maybe it's better to process them in parallel or sequentially.\n\nWait, but Midio processes nodes in a flow. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after finding both items, their values are available for multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a Map function to find the first even and odd, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Use two separate For loops, each iterating through the list once to find the first even and odd. But that would process the list twice, which is acceptable since it's manageable.\n\nBut using Find seems more efficient as it stops at the first occurrence.\n\nSo, let me outline the code:\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The function has an input 'list' property of type List.\n   - Output is a number.\n\n2. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an Iteration.Find node.\n   - Connect the list to its 'items' input.\n   - Set the predicate to check if item % 2 == 0.\n   - Capture the found item as even_num.\n\n3. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find node.\n   - Same list connected.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0.\n   - Capture as odd_num.\n\n4. **Multiply**:\n   - Use Math.Mul with even_num and odd_num.\n   - Output the result.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I connect these? Each Find node will have its own 'item' output which can be connected to variables or directly used in the multiplication.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function call is a separate execution. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after both items are found, their values are passed to the multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, since the Find nodes are independent, maybe I can connect them in parallel and then combine their outputs.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Maybe using a Combine or Zip function?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the list once with a custom handler that tracks both first even and odd numbers. But that would require more complex logic within a single Map or For loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can use two separate Find nodes and then multiply their results.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n- Create two Find instances: find_even and find_odd.\n- Both take the input list.\n- Each has its own predicate.\n- The outputs of these finds are connected to variables even_num and odd_num.\n- Then, connect these variables to a Math.Mul node which produces the output.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I capture the outputs of Find nodes? They have an 'item' output property. So perhaps:\n\n- find_even.item -> even_num\n- find_odd.item -> odd_num\n\nThen, even_num and odd_num are connected as inputs to Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each node can only be executed once per function call. So if I use two Find nodes on the same list, they will both process the entire list until their respective conditions are met.\n\nBut that's acceptable since it's a small overhead for most lists.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The input list",

But that requires more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nLet me consider which approach is better in Midio.\n\nUsing two Find nodes might be straightforward but could process the list twice, which isn't ideal for large lists. However, it's simpler to implement.\n\nAlternatively, using a single For loop:\n\n- Initialize variables to hold the first even and odd.\n- Iterate through each item.\n   - If an even is found and not yet captured, store it.\n   - Similarly for odd.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop early.\n\nBut Midio's node-based approach might make this more complex. I'd need to manage state variables, which could involve using a Count or other looping constructs.\n\nHmm, perhaps for simplicity and given that the list isn't expected to be extremely large, using two Find nodes is acceptable.\n\nSo, let me proceed with two Find nodes.\n\nNow, in Midio code:\n\n- Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n   - The handler function checks if the item is even.\n- Another instance for odd numbers.\n   - Handler checks for odd.\n- Connect both found items to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will process the entire list. So I need to make sure that once an even and odd are found, they're correctly captured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single For loop with two variables:\n\n- Initialize firstEven and firstOdd as null.\n- Iterate through each item in the list.\n   - If current item is even and firstEven is null, set firstEven.\n   - If current item is odd and firstOdd is null, set firstOdd.\n   - Once both are found, break.\n\nBut implementing this requires a way to track state. Midio's For loop can be used with variables to hold the state.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop on the list.\n- Inside the loop, use If expressions to check if the current item is even or odd.\n   - Update firstEven and firstOdd accordingly.\n- Once both are found, stop processing further items.\n\nBut Midio's node-based approach doesn't allow for breaking out of loops easily. So perhaps using a combination of For and some conditional logic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to process the list twice with two Find nodes.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create a Find node for even numbers.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- Another Find node for odd numbers.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- Multiply the results of both Find nodes.\n\nBut wait, how do I connect these to Math.Mul? Each Find node's output is an item. So I can connect them as inputs to a Math.Mul node.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function has specific inputs and outputs. The Iteration.Find node returns the found item through its 'item' output.\n\nSo, for evenFind:\n\n- Connect list -> evenFind.items\n- evenFind.item -> mul.first\n\nFor oddFind:\n\n- Connect list -> oddFind.items\n- oddFind.item -> mul.second\n\nThen, mul.result is connected to the output.\n\nBut what if one of them isn't found?

The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node needs a handler function. So I'll need to create predicate functions for each.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using IfExpression within the Find handlers can help determine if an item is even or odd.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this in Midio nodes:\n\n1. **First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - The handler for Find will be a function that returns true when the item is even.\n\n2. **First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\nBut in Midio, each Find node can only find one item, so I need to process the list twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single loop and tracking both first even and first odd as I go through the list would be more efficient. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice. But for the sake of simplicity and given that the problem doesn't specify performance constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **Input List**: Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- **Find Even**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- **Find Odd**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- **Multiply Results**: Take the outputs from both Find nodes and multiply them.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node returns a single item. So I can connect these two items to a Math.Mul node.\n\nNow, let me think about how to implement this in code:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n2. Create another instance of Iteration.Find for odd numbers.\n3. Connect the list input to both Find nodes.\n4. For each Find node, set up a predicate function using IfExpression or similar.\n5. Take the outputs from both Find nodes and connect them to Math.Mul.\n6. The result of Math.Mul is the output.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, functions are triggered based on events. So I need to ensure that both Find operations complete before proceeding to multiply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a For loop to iterate through each element once, keeping track of the first even and odd encountered.\n\nLet me think about this approach:\n\n- Use a single For loop over the list.\n- Initialize variables for first_even and first_odd as null or undefined.\n- As each item is processed:\n   - If it's even and first_even hasn't been found yet, set first_even to this item.\n   - If it's odd and first_odd hasn't been found yet, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming languages. So I need to find a way to track these states using available nodes.\n\nThis might be more complex but could be more efficient as it processes the list only once.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. **Initialize State Variables**:\n   - first_even: null\n   - first_odd: null\n\n2. **For Loop**:\n   - Iterate over each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Continue until both are found.\n\n3. **Multiply**:\n   - Once the loop completes,",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will finish. So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items.

So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",

So maybe after finding both, I can trigger a reset to exit early? Or perhaps it's easier to just process all items but only set the first occurrences.\n\nAnother thought: since I need the first even and first odd, their positions might not be in order. The first even could come before or after the first odd. So I have to check each item in sequence until both are found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to determine if it's even or odd.\n- When an even is found and first_even isn't set yet, set first_even.\n- Similarly for odd.\n- Once both are set, compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use multiple IfExpression nodes within the loop. But Midio doesn't allow nesting functions in that way.

Create a For loop node (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a.

Once both are found, compute the difference using Math.Sub (even - odd).\n4. Output this result.\n\nBut how do I track whether first_even and first_odd have been set? Since Midio doesn't support variables directly, perhaps I can use properties or some stateful nodes like List.Add to build up the necessary information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a simple counter approach, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps using two separate IfExpression nodes within the For loop:\n\n- The first checks if the item is even and whether first_even hasn't been set yet. If so, sets first_even.\n- The second checks if the item is odd and whether first_odd hasn't been set yet. If so, sets first_odd.\n\nOnce both are set, I can compute their difference.\n\nBut how do I ensure that once both are found, the loop stops? Because in Midio, the For loop will continue until all items are processed unless reset.\n\nHmm, maybe it's acceptable to process all items but only take the first occurrences. So even if there are more evens or odds later, they won't overwrite the first ones.\n\nSo, I can proceed without worrying about stopping early because the first_even and first_odd will remain as the first occurrences regardless of subsequent items.\n\nOnce both are set, compute their difference and output it.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- For each item in the list:\n   - If even and first_even is",

So perhaps after setting both values, I just proceed to compute the difference regardless of whether there are more items left.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item:\n   - Check if it's even using IfExpression.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   - Else, check if it's odd using another IfExpression.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n   - After setting both, perhaps I can break the loop by not processing further items. But Midio doesn't support breaking; instead, maybe after setting both, I can trigger a continue event to exit.\n\nWait, but in Midio, once you've processed all items, the loop will end naturally. So even if I don't set any flags after finding both, it's okay because the function will proceed to compute the difference as soon as both are found.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use two IfExpression nodes: one for checking even and another for odd.\n- Each time an item is processed, check if it meets the condition and whether we've already found the required number.\n- Set properties first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n- After processing all items, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need to ensure that once both are found, further processing doesn't interfere. However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of Map and Filter functions. Alternatively, maybe using a custom handler within an Iteration.Map to process each item and update the first_even and first_odd as needed.\n\nWait, another idea: iterate through the list with For, and for each item, check if it's even or odd. Use IfExpression nodes to determine which case we're in and update the respective variables accordingly.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to maintain state across iterations in Midio. Maybe using a List.Add or similar to build up the necessary information as we go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps process the list twice: once to find the first even, and once to find the first odd. But that might be less efficient, but given that the lists are likely not too large, it could be acceptable.\n\nWait, no, processing the list once is better for efficiency. So I need a way to track both values in a single pass.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio nodes.\n\nI can create two variables: first_even and first_odd, initialized as null or some default value. Then, as I iterate through each item:\n\n- For the current item, check if it's even.\n  - If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n- Check if it's odd.\n  - If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n- After each step, check if both are found. If so, break the loop.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in functions; instead, I can use properties or some form of stateful nodes like List.Add to accumulate these values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a custom function within an Iteration.Map that keeps track of first_even and first_odd as it processes each item.\n\nWait, maybe using a handler function inside Iteration.Map where each call updates the state. But Midio's functions are more about transforming data rather than maintaining state across iterations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can use multiple passes over the list to find the first even and then another pass for the first odd.\n\nFirst, iterate through the list to find the first even number:\n\n- Use an IfExpression to check if each item is even.\n- Once found, store it as first_even and stop processing.\n\nThen, do the same for the first odd number.\n\nOnce I have both values, compute their difference.\n\nBut this would require two separate iterations over the list. Is that acceptable? Well, given that the lists are likely not too large, it's manageable.\n\nSo, let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list to find the first even number.\n   - For each item, check if it's even using IfExpression (n % 2 == 0).\n   - When found, store it and break out of the loop.\n2. Do another For loop on the same list to find the first odd number.\n   - Similarly, check if n % 2 != 0.\n3. Once both numbers are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n\nBut how do I implement this in Midio? Let's think about the nodes.\n\nFor step 1:\n\n- Use For on the list to iterate each item.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n- When true, store the value as first_even and trigger a continue or something.\n\nWait, but how do I break out of the loop once found? Midio doesn't have explicit break statements. Maybe after finding the first_even, set a flag that tells subsequent iterations to stop processing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a filter to find all even numbers and take the first one, then do the same for odd.\n\nWait, another approach: Use List.FirstItem on the filtered list of evens and odds.\n\nYes! That's a better idea. Because if I can filter the list to get only even numbers, then take the first item, that gives me the first_even. Similarly for odds.\n\nSo:\n\n- For first_even:\n   - Filter the list where each item is even.\n   - Take the first item from this filtered list.\n- For first_odd:\n   - Filter the list where each item is odd.\n   - Take the first item from this filtered list.\n\nThen, compute their difference.\n\nThis approach uses two separate filters and first items. It's straightforward and leverages Midio's built-in functions effectively.\n\nSo, let me structure the code accordingly:\n\n1. Use Query.Filter on the input list to get all even numbers.\n2. Use List.FirstItem on this filtered list to get first_even.",

Subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut wait, what if the list doesn't contain any even or odd numbers? The function might return null or cause an error. But perhaps the task assumes that there is at least one even and one odd number in the list.\n\nAssuming that's the case, I can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, in Midio code:\n\n- Create a filter for even numbers where it % 2 == 0.\n- Get the first item from this filtered list as first_even.\n- Similarly, create another filter for odd numbers where it % 2 != 0.\n- Get the first item from this filtered list as first_odd.\n- Subtract first_odd from first_even to get the difference.\n\nBut how do I get the first item of a list in Midio?

Use List.FirstItem on even_numbers to get first_even.\n3. Use Query.Filter with where: \"it % 2 != 0\" on the input list to get odd_numbers.\n4. Use List.FirstItem on odd_numbers to get first_odd.\n5. Subtract first_odd from first_even using Math.Sub.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are connected via their outputs and inputs.

So I can connect these properties to Math.Sub's inputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use an Iteration.Map to process each element and track the first even and odd.\n\nBut considering time constraints, using two separate filters might be simpler.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed in sequence, so I need to make sure that both first_even and first_odd are computed before performing the subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a single pass with a custom handler within an Iteration.Map.

However, since the list might have more elements after the first even and odd, but we only care about the first occurrences, it's okay because once set, subsequent checks won't overwrite them.\n\nWait, no. Because if the loop continues, any later even or odd numbers would not affect the first_even and first_odd values since they are already set. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\n- Create a For loop node connected to the input list.\n- Connect each item to an IfExpression to check for evenness.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even.\n- Then, connect the same item to another IfExpression to check for oddness.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n- After processing all items, subtract first_odd from first_even.\n\nBut how do I represent this in Midio's node structure?\n\nI think I'll need:\n\n1. A For loop (Std.For) connected to the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, for each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even.\n      - If true and first_even is null, set first_even.\n   b. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n      - If true and first_odd is null, set first_odd.\n3. After the loop, compute the difference using Math.Sub.\n\nBut I need nodes for setting properties. So perhaps:\n\n- Use setter nodes to assign the item value to first_even or first_odd when conditions are met.\n\nWait, Midio allows creating properties via setters. So I can have a setter node that sets first_even when an even number is found and it's null.\n\nSimilarly for first_odd.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Create two setter nodes: one for first_even and one for first_odd.\n- These setters are triggered only when the respective condition (even or odd) is met and the property is still null.\n\nBut how to represent that in Mid",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called diff_even_odd that finds the difference between the first even and the first odd number in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the function needs to do. It takes a list of numbers as input. From this list, it should find the first occurrence of an even number and the first occurrence of an odd number. Then, it calculates the difference between these two numbers (even minus odd) and returns that value.\n\nI remember Midio has various functions for list manipulation. I'll probably need to iterate through the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Once I have those two values, subtracting them should give me the desired result.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, check if it's even or odd.\n3. Record the first even number encountered.\n4. Record the first odd number encountered.\n5. Once both are found, compute their difference (even - odd).\n6. Return this difference as the output.\n\nI think using an Iteration.Map might help here because I can process each element and keep track of the first even and odd numbers. Alternatively, maybe using a combination of filters to separate evens and odds could work, but since I only need the first occurrences, perhaps it's more efficient to iterate once.\n\nWait, another approach: use two separate variables to track the first even and first odd. As I loop through each element, check if it's even or odd. Once both are found, break out of the loop as no further elements are needed.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support traditional loops in the same way as other languages. Instead, I should use the provided nodes like Std.For to iterate over the list.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with Midio's nodes.\n\nI can start by using a For loop on the input list. For each item, I'll check if it's even or odd. The first time I encounter an even number, I'll store it. Similarly, the first time I encounter an odd number, I'll store that as well.\n\nOnce both are found, I can stop processing further items and compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use some conditional logic here. Maybe using IfExpression nodes to check if a number is even or odd.\n\nWait, how do I check if a number is even or odd in Midio? Oh right, using the modulo function. For example, if n % 2 == 0, then it's even; else, it's odd.\n\nSo, for each item in the list:\n\n- Use Math.Modulo to see if it's even or odd.\n- If it's even and I haven't found an even yet, store it as first_even.\n- If it's odd and I haven't found an odd yet, store it as first_odd.\n- Once both are found, stop processing.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I can use properties or some stateful nodes to keep track of these values.\n\nHmm, perhaps using a combination of IfExpression and setting properties when certain conditions are met.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Initialize two properties: first_even and first_odd, both set to null initially.\n2. Iterate through each item in the list using For.\n3. For each item:\n   a. Use IfExpression to check if it's even (item % 2 == 0).\n   b. If yes and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   c. Else, use another IfExpression to check if it's odd.\n   d. If yes and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n4. Once both are found, compute the difference (first_even - first_odd).\n5. Return this difference.\n\nBut how do I stop processing once both are found? Midio's For loop doesn't have a break statement, so perhaps after setting both, I can trigger the continue event to exit the loop.\n\nAlternatively, since I'm using a For loop, each iteration processes one item, and once both first_even and first_odd are set, I can stop further processing by not updating any more properties or by triggering the continue event.\n\nWait, but in Midio, the For loop will process all items unless told to reset. So maybe after finding both, I can trigger a reset to exit early? Or perhaps it's easier to just process all items but only set the first occurrences.\n\nAnother thought: since I need the first even and first odd, their positions might not be in order. The first even could come before or after the first odd. So I have to check each item in sequence until both are found.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this with nodes:\n\n- Use a For loop on the input list.\n- For each item, use IfExpression to determine if it's even or odd.\n- When an even is found and first_even isn't set yet, set first_even.\n- Similarly for odd.\n- Once both are set, compute their difference.\n\nI might need to use multiple IfExpression nodes within the loop. But Midio doesn't allow nesting functions in that way. So perhaps I can chain the IfExpressions or use a combination of triggers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a single IfExpression with conditions to check for even and odd, and update the respective properties accordingly.\n\nWait, another approach: since I'm only interested in the first occurrences, I can process each item in order and set the properties as soon as they are found. Once both are found, any subsequent items can be ignored.\n\nBut how do I ignore them? Maybe by using a condition to check if both are already set before processing further.\n\nHmm, perhaps after setting first_even or first_odd, I can have conditions that skip further checks once both are found.\n\nAlternatively, since the For loop will process all items regardless, but I can just not update the properties once they're set. That way, even if more evens or odds come later, they won't overwrite the first ones.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\n- Initialize first_even and first_odd as null.\n- Iterate through each item:\n   - If item is even and first_even is null: set first_even = item\n   - Else if item is odd and first_odd is null: set first_odd = item\n- After all items are processed, compute difference.\n\nBut wait, this approach would require processing the entire list, which might not be efficient. However, for simplicity, it's manageable.\n\nSo in Midio terms:\n\n1. Use a For loop on the input list.\n2. Inside the loop, use IfExpression to check if the item is even or odd.\n3. Update first_even and first_odd accordingly.\n4. After the loop completes, compute the difference between first_even and first_odd.\n\nBut how do I handle the computation after the loop? Maybe using a Math.Sub node that subtracts first_odd from first_even.\n\nWait, but in Midio, properties are set based on triggers. So perhaps after the For loop has processed all items, I can trigger a node to compute the difference.\n\nAlternatively, since the For loop's done event is triggered when it finishes processing all items, I can connect that to a Math.Sub node that calculates the difference.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Create two properties: first_even and first_odd.\n- Use a For loop on the input list. Connect each item to an IfExpression to check if even or odd.\n- When an even is found (and first_even is null), set it using a setter.\n- Similarly for odd.\n- Once all items are processed"

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"sum / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can't be directly referenced like this in expressions unless they are passed as parameters. So I need to ensure that the expressions correctly reference the input 'n'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each step sequentially using Math nodes.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the sum is n*(n+1)/2 and average is (n+1)/2, maybe I can compute both directly without generating the list. That would be more efficient.\n\nSo, for sum:\n\nsum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\naverage = sum / n = (n + 1) / 2\n\nThis simplifies things because I don't need to generate the list at all. I can compute both values directly using Math.Expression nodes.\n\nThat's a better approach as it avoids unnecessary steps and is more efficient, especially for large n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n- The first expression will be \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- The second expression will be \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n\nThen, combine these two results into a single output. Since the output is of type Any, I can create a list containing both values.\n\nTo create a list with sum and average, I'll use List.Add twice:\n\nFirst, add the sum to an empty list, then add the average to that list.\n\nAlternatively, since List.GenerateRange isn't needed anymore, perhaps just compute each value and combine them into a list.\n\nWait, but how do I structure this in Midio? Let me think about the nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n1. An instance of Math.Expression for sum.\n2. Another instance of Math.Expression for average.\n3. Use List.Add to create a list starting with sum, then add average to it.\n\nBut since List.Add returns a new list each time, I can chain them together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to 0 (but that doesn't make sense). Or maybe just create an empty list and add both values.\n\nWait, no. Since the output is a single Any type, which can hold a list or an object, I'll proceed by creating a list with two elements: sum and average.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\n- Create an empty list using List.Empty.\n- Add sum to this list, resulting in [sum].\n- Then add average to this new list, resulting in [sum, average].\n\nBut wait, each call to List.Add creates a new list. So first, I have an empty list. After adding sum, it becomes [sum]. Then, adding average would create [sum, average].\n\nSo, the code will involve:\n\n- An empty list.\n- Add sum to it.\n- Then add average to that.\n\nBut in Midio, each List.Add is a separate node, so I'll need two List.Add instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n, but since we're not using the actual numbers, just their count and properties, it's more efficient to compute directly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Input 'n' is provided.\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with expression \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Compute average using Math.Expression with expression \"(n + 1) / 2\".\n- Create an empty list.\n- Add sum to the empty list, resulting",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3. Compute the average by dividing the sum by n using another Math.Expression.\n4. Combine these two results into a single output structure.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a property of type Any named output_ebef81. So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can create a list with two elements: [sum, average].\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows for more complex structures, maybe an object like { sum: ..., average: ... }, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at previous examples, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange and then Iteration.Map to apply operations. But in this case, since the formula is known, using Math.Expression is more efficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Create a node for List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions? Each Math.Expression needs its inputs. So perhaps:\n\n- For sum: use a Math.Expression where the expression is \"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", and provide x as n.\n- For average: use another Math.Expression with expression \"sum / x\", providing both sum and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows using variables from other nodes in expressions. Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, let me outline the nodes:\n\n- n: input property.\n- generate_range: List.GenerateRange(from=1, to=n).\n- compute_sum: Math.Expression(expression=\"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", inputs=[n]).\n- compute_average: Math.Expression(expression=\"sum / x\", inputs=[compute_sum.result, n]).\n\nBut I'm not sure if the expressions can reference variables like 'sum' directly. It might require that all necessary values are passed as parameters to the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use a single Math.Expression node with both sum and average computed in one go, but that could complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: since the formula for average is (n+1)/2, because average = sum / n = [n(n+1)/2] / n = (n+1)/2. So perhaps compute average directly as (n + 1) / 2.\n\nThat might simplify things. So:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(x * (x + 1))",

So I can return an object or a list containing both sum and average.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects separate outputs for sum and average, but according to the signature, there's only one output. Therefore, I'll structure the output as a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average.\n\nWait, no, in Midio, each function can have multiple outputs, but in this case, the provided signature has only one output named \"output\". So I need to combine both values into that single output. Maybe as an object with two properties: sum and average.\n\nBut looking at the sample code for similar functions, sometimes they return a list or a simple value. Since the function is supposed to find both sum and average, perhaps returning them in a structured format makes sense.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by:\n\n- Using List.GenerateRange to get the numbers from 1 to n.\n- Calculating the sum using Math.Expression with the formula \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n- Calculating the average as \"sum / n\" using another Math.Expression node.\n- Combining these two results into an object or a list.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I combine them? Maybe create a list where the first element is the sum and the second is the average. Alternatively, use a record type if supported.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to return a list containing both values. So, after computing sum and average, I can add them to a list using List.Add or similar functions.\n\nAlternatively, since Math.Expression can compute both in one go, but that might complicate the expression string.\n\nLet me outline the nodes needed:\n\n1. Generate the range: List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Compute sum: Math.Expression with \"(n * (n + 1)) / 2\".\n3. Compute average: Math.Expression with \"(sum) / n\".\n4. Combine sum and average into a list.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, variables can be used across nodes. So after computing the sum, I can use it directly in the average calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate Math.Expressions:\n\n- First for sum.\n- Second for average, referencing the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows that. Each Math.Expression node might need to have all variables provided as inputs.\n\nHmm, maybe a better approach is to compute both sum and average in one step using a single expression, but that could make the code less readable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to compute them separately and then combine the results into a list or object.\n\nSo, let me structure the function:\n\n- Input n.\n- Generate range 1 to n.\n- Compute sum as (n*(n+1))/2.\n- Compute average as sum / n.\n- Create an output that contains both sum and average.\n\nBut according to the signature, the output is of type Any. So perhaps I can create a list with two elements: [sum, average].\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows for more complex structures, maybe an object like { sum: ..., average: ... }, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at previous examples, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange and then Iteration.Map to apply operations. But in this case, since the formula is known, using Math.Expression is more efficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Create a node for List.GenerateRange from 1 to n.\n2. Use two Math.Expression nodes: one for sum and another for average.\n3. Combine these results into a list or object.\n\nWait, but how do I pass the value of 'n' into the Math.Expressions? Each Math.Expression needs its inputs. So perhaps:\n\n- For sum: use a Math.Expression where the expression is \"(x * (x + 1)) / 2\", and provide x as n.\n- For average: use another Math.Expression with expression \"sum / x\", providing both sum and x.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows using variables from other nodes in expressions. Alternatively, perhaps each Math.Expression node can take the necessary inputs directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the sum first, then pass that into the average calculation.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are executed based on connections. So I need to ensure that the sum is computed before the average.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression with n as input.\n- Then, compute average by dividing the sum by n.\n\nBut how do I pass both values into the average calculation? Maybe use a function node that takes two inputs: sum and n.\n\nAlternatively, create another Math.Expression for average where the expression is \"sum / n\", but then I need to provide both sum and n as inputs to this node.\n\nWait, perhaps each Math.Expression can have multiple inputs. For example, in the first Math.Expression for sum, I pass n as x, and in the second, I pass sum as a and n as b, with expression \"a / b\".\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange to create the list from 1 to n. But actually, since we're using the formula, maybe this isn't necessary. We can directly compute the sum without generating the list.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I don't need to generate the list at all. Since the sum of first n natural numbers is known",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called sum_average that calculates both the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that the first n natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, ..., n. The sum of these numbers can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Once I have the sum, the average is simply the sum divided by n.\n\nBut since we're working in Midio, which uses a node-based approach, I'll need to construct this calculation step by step using the available functions.\n\nLet me start by considering how to generate the first n natural numbers. The List.GenerateRange function can create a list from 1 to n. So I'll use that to get the list of numbers.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the sum of these numbers. Instead of manually adding each element, which would be inefficient, especially for large n, I can use the Math.Expression node to evaluate the formula directly. This will compute the sum as (n * (n + 1)) / 2.\n\nOnce I have the sum, calculating the average is straightforward: divide the sum by n. Again, I'll use a Math.Expression node for this calculation.\n\nNow, I need to combine both the sum and average into a single output. Since Midio allows outputs of type 'Any', which can hold multiple values, I'll create a list containing both results or perhaps an object with keys like \"sum\" and \"average\". However, looking at the provided signature, the output is of type Any, so returning a list might be appropriate.\n\nWait, but in the sample code provided earlier for similar tasks, sometimes they used List.GenerateRange followed by Iteration.Map to apply operations. But since I can directly compute sum using Math.Expression, that would be more efficient and straightforward.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Use List.GenerateRange from 1 to n to get the list of numbers.\n2. Compute the sum using the formula with Math.Expression.\n3.

It might require that all necessary values are passed as parameters to the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use a single Math.Expression node with both sum and average computed in one go, but that could complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach: since the formula for average is (n+1)/2, because average = sum / n = [n(n+1)/2] / n = (n+1)/2. So perhaps compute average directly as (n + 1) / 2.\n\nThat might simplify things. So:\n\n- Compute sum using Math.Expression: \"(x * (x + 1))",

                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will only find one item. So I can connect their 'item' outputs to the multiplication function.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are connected via triggers and properties. Let me think about how to wire this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Map or Filter isn't necessary here since we just need the first occurrence of each.\n\nWait, another approach: use List.FirstItem for both even and odd. But FirstItem only gives the first item in the list, not based on a condition. So that won't work directly.\n\nSo back to Iteration.Find. Each Find node can be configured with a predicate function (using IfExpression) to check if the item is even or odd.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an instance of Iteration.Find.\n   - The handler function for this Find will return true when the item is even.\n   \n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two items obtained from the Find nodes.\n\nBut how do I connect these in Midio? Each Find node will have an 'item' output that can be connected to the multiplication function.\n\nWait, but each Find is a separate process. So perhaps I need to chain them or use some kind of variable storage to hold the first even and odd numbers until both are found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to iterate through the list once, keeping track of whether we've found an even and/or odd number yet.\n\nThis might require using variables to store the first even and first odd as they're encountered. Then, after processing all elements, multiply them if both exist.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have a built-in variable storage node, so I'd need to use some workaround, perhaps by using List.FirstItem or other functions creatively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can process the list twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n- **First Pass (Find Even)**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with a predicate that checks if the item is even.\n   - Store the result in a variable or directly use it.\n\n- **Second Pass (Find Odd)**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find on the same list, but looking for odd numbers.\n\nBut how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Each Find would process the entire list until it finds its target.\n\nWait, perhaps I can connect both Find nodes to the same list and let them each find their respective items independently.\n\nOnce both have found their items, multiply them together.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first with predicate \"it % 2 == 0\".\n   - The second with predicate \"it % 2 != 0\".\n\n- Connect the 'item' outputs of both Find nodes to Math.Mul's inputs.\n\nBut wait, Midio functions typically take inputs and produce outputs. So perhaps I need to connect them in a way that after both have their items, they are passed to the multiplication function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use two separate variables to store each found item and then multiply them.\n\nBut since Midio doesn't support variables directly, perhaps using List.FirstItem or other functions isn't feasible here.\n\nWait, another idea: Use a single For loop to iterate through the list once. For each item, check if it's even or odd, and if we haven't found one yet, store it. Once both are found, break out of the loop and compute the product.\n\nBut implementing this in Midio would require more complex logic with conditions and possibly multiple triggers.\n\nLet me outline how to do that:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - Create two variables: firstEven and first",

But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice. But for the sake of simplicity and given that the problem doesn't specify performance constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **Input List**: Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- **Find Even**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- **Find Odd**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- **Multiply Results**: Take the outputs from both Find nodes and multiply them.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node returns a single item. So I can connect these two items to a Math.Mul node.\n\nNow, let me think about how to implement this in code:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n2. Create another instance of Iteration.Find for odd numbers.\n3. Connect the list input to both Find nodes.\n4. For each Find node, set up a predicate function using IfExpression or similar.\n5. Take the outputs from both Find nodes and connect them to Math.Mul.\n6. The result of Math.Mul is the output.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, functions are triggered based on events. So I need to ensure that both Find operations complete before proceeding to multiply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a For loop to iterate through each element once, keeping track of the first even and odd encountered.\n\nLet me think about this approach:\n\n- Use a single For loop over the list.\n- Initialize variables for first_even and first_odd as null or undefined.\n- As each item is processed:\n   - If it's even and first_even hasn't been found yet, set first_even to this item.\n   - If it's odd and first_odd hasn't been found yet, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't support variables in the same way as traditional programming languages. So I need to find a way to track these states using available nodes.\n\nThis might be more complex but could be more efficient as it processes the list only once.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. **Initialize State Variables**:\n   - first_even: null\n   - first_odd: null\n\n2. **For Loop**:\n   - Iterate over each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Continue until both are found.\n\n3. **Multiply**:\n   - Once the loop completes,",

Instead, we can use setters and getters to manage state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate For loops: one for even and one for odd, but that might not be efficient as it would process the list twice.\n\nWait, maybe I can create a custom handler within a For loop that captures both first_even and first_odd in a single pass. But Midio's handlers are functions that can't maintain state between iterations unless using some form of context variable.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe sticking with two Find nodes is simpler, even if it processes the list twice.\n\nBut what if the list has multiple evens and odds? The Find node will return the first occurrence for each predicate.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Use Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- Use another Iteration.Find for odd numbers.\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- Multiply the two results.\n\nBut how to connect this in Midio's node-based flow. Let me think about the nodes needed:\n\n1. **For Loop**: To iterate through each element, but perhaps not necessary if using Find.\n2. **Find Node for Even**:\n   - Connects to a handler that checks if the item is even.\n3. **Find Node for Odd**:\n   - Similarly, connects to a handler checking for odd.\n4. **Math.Mul**: Takes the outputs from both Find nodes.\n\nWait, but each Find node will only find one item. So I can connect their 'item' outputs to the Math.Mul inputs.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I ensure that both items are available before multiplying? Because if the list is processed sequentially, the even might be found first, then the odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a variable to store the even number and another for the odd. But again, Midio's approach doesn't support variables directly; instead, we can use setters and getters.\n\nWait, maybe I can structure it like this:\n\n- Use two Find nodes in parallel.\n   - Both process the same list but with different predicates.\n   - Once both have their items, multiply them.\n\nBut how to synchronize that? Midio's execution model might not support waiting for both to complete before proceeding. So perhaps using a For loop is better because it processes each item sequentially, allowing me to capture both first_even and first_odd as I go.\n\nLet me try structuring the code with a For loop:\n\n- Create a For node connected to the input list.\n- Inside the handler of the For loop, check if the current item is even or odd.\n   - If it's even and first_even hasn't been set yet, store it.\n   - Similarly for odd.\n- Once both are found, compute their product.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle cases where one of them isn't found? Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will only find one item. So I can connect their 'item' outputs to the multiplication function.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are connected via triggers and properties. Let me think about how to wire this up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a Map or Filter isn't necessary here since we just need the first occurrence of each.\n\nWait, another approach: use List.FirstItem for both even and odd. But FirstItem only gives the first item in the list, not based on a condition. So that won't work directly.\n\nSo back to Iteration.Find. Each Find node can be configured with a predicate function (using IfExpression) to check if the item is even or odd.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Create an instance of Iteration.Find.\n   - The handler function for this Find will return true when the item is even.\n   \n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find with a predicate checking for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two items obtained from the Find nodes.\n\nBut how do I connect these in Midio? Each Find node will have an 'item' output that can be connected to the multiplication function.\n\nWait, but each Find is a separate process. So perhaps I need to chain them or use some way to capture both results before multiplying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can first find the even number, then find the odd number in the same list, and then multiply them.\n\nBut how do I structure this flow? Maybe using triggers to execute one after another.\n\nLet me think about the code structure:\n\n- Create a function with inputs for the list.\n- Use two Find nodes: one for even, one for odd.\n- Connect their outputs to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions are connected via their triggers and properties. So perhaps I can have both Find nodes execute when the input list is provided, then their results are used in the multiplication.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible because each Find might need to process the entire list independently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a For loop to iterate through the list once, keeping track of the first even and odd numbers found. That way, I only traverse the list once.\n\nLet me consider using a For loop:\n\n- Initialize variables for firstEven and firstOdd as null.\n- Iterate over each item in the list:\n   - If the current item is even and firstEven is null, set firstEven to this item.\n   - If the current item is odd and firstOdd is null, set firstOdd to this item.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, I might need to use some stateful nodes like Count or others that can maintain state across iterations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a combination of For and If nodes to track the first even and odd.\n\nWait, maybe I can create two separate processes: one for finding the first even and another for the first odd, both iterating over the same list but in parallel. Then, when both have their results, multiply them.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Let me think about using a single For loop with some conditions.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\n- Use a For loop to iterate through each item.\n- For each item, check if it's even and if firstEven hasn't been found yet. If so, set firstEven.\n- Similarly, check if it's odd and if firstOdd hasn't been found yet. If so, set firstOdd.\n- Once both are found, perhaps break the loop early or continue until the end.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I represent these variables? Maybe using List",

But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, maybe it's better to proceed with two separate Find operations.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node will process the entire list until it finds the first matching item. So for a large list, this could be inefficient since the list is processed twice. But for the sake of simplicity and given that the problem doesn't specify performance constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, let's outline the code structure:\n\n- **Input List**: Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- **Find Even**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n- **Find Odd**:\n   - Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n- **Multiply Results**: Take the outputs from both Find nodes and multiply them.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node returns a single item. So I can connect these two items to a Math.Mul node.\n\nNow, let me think about how to implement this in code:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n2.

So I need to find a way to track these states using available nodes.\n\nThis might be more complex but could be more efficient as it processes the list only once.\n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. **Initialize State Variables**:\n   - first_even: null\n   - first_odd: null\n\n2. **For Loop**:\n   - Iterate over each item in the list.\n   - For each item, check if it's even or odd.\n   - If even and first_even is null, set first_even to this item.\n   - If odd and first_odd is null, set first_odd to this item.\n   - Continue until both are found.\n\n3. **Multiply**:\n   - Once the loop completes,",

Each Find node will have its own 'item' output which can be connected to variables or directly used in the multiplication.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each function call is a separate execution. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after both items are found, their values are passed to the multiplier.\n\nAlternatively, since the Find nodes are independent, maybe I can connect them in parallel and then combine their outputs.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to handle this in Midio's node-based flow. Maybe using a Combine or Zip function?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the list once with a custom handler that tracks both first even and odd numbers. But that would require more complex logic within a single Map or For loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can use two separate Find nodes and then multiply their results.\n\nLet me try structuring this:\n\n- Create two Find instances: find_even and find_odd.\n- Both take the input list.\n- Each has its own predicate.\n- The outputs of these finds are connected to variables even_num and odd_num.\n- Then, connect these variables to a Math.Mul node which produces the output.\n\nBut in Midio, how do I capture the outputs of Find nodes? They have an 'item' output property. So perhaps:\n\n- find_even.item -> even_num\n- find_odd.item -> odd_num\n\nThen, even_num and odd_num are connected as inputs to Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each node can only be executed once per function call. So if I use two Find nodes on the same list, they will both process the entire list until their respective conditions are met.\n\nBut that's acceptable since it's a small overhead for most lists.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The input list",
                "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a Midio function called mul_even_odd that finds the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what's required. The function takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product after multiplying the first even number with the first odd number from that list.\n\nHmm, so I need to process the list to find both the first even and the first odd numbers. Then multiply them together.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Find the first even number in the list**: I'll iterate through each element until I find one that's even.\n2. **Find the first odd number in the list**: Similarly, iterate until an odd number is found.\n3. **Multiply these two numbers**: Once both are identified, compute their product.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number since it's asking for their product. So I don't need to handle cases where they're missing.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Midio using the provided functions.\n\nI remember Midio has iteration nodes like For and Map, which can help loop through lists. Also, there are filter functions that might be useful.\n\nLet me think about using a For loop to iterate over each element. But since I need both first even and odd, maybe two separate loops would work. Alternatively, perhaps I can process the list in a way that captures both in one pass, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Find function from Iteration to locate the first occurrence of an even and then the same for an odd.\n\nWait, Midio has an Iteration.Find node which can find the first item satisfying a predicate. So maybe I can create two Find nodes: one looking for the first even number and another for the first odd.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me outline the steps:\n\n- Use Find to get the first even number.\n- Use Find again to get the first odd number.\n- Multiply these two numbers using Math.Mul.\n\nBut how do I structure this in Midio? Each Find node would take a handler function checking if the item is even or odd, respectively.\n\nWait, but each Find node can only find one item. So for the list, I need to process it twice: once for evens and once for odds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the list once, keeping track of both the first even and the first odd encountered. But that might require more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nBut given Midio's node-based approach, maybe using two separate Find operations is simpler.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find on the list.\n   - The predicate function checks if the item is even (item % 2 == 0).\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Similarly, use another Iteration.Find on the same list.\n   - Predicate checks for odd numbers.\n\n3. **Multiply the Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul to multiply the two found items.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node can only be used once per function call. So I need to create two separate Find instances: one for even and one for odd.\n\nWait, no. The list is processed once by each Find, but since they are separate nodes, it's acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Connect the input list to both Find nodes.\n- Each Find node has its own predicate (even or odd).\n- Capture their outputs.\n- Multiply them.\n\nBut how do I handle cases where there might be no even or odd numbers? The problem statement probably assumes that each exists, so we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, let me think about the Midio code structure.\n\nI'll start by creating two Find nodes. Each will take the list as input and have a predicate function.\n\nFor the first Find (even):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 == 0\n\nFor the second Find (odd):\n\n- Predicate: item % 2 != 0\n\nOnce both items are found, multiply them using Math.Mul.\n\nWait, but in Midio, each Find node returns the item through its 'item' output. So I can connect these to variables and then use them in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can chain the operations: first find even, then find odd, then multiply.\n\nBut since both finds are independent, maybe it's better to process them in parallel or sequentially.\n\nWait, but Midio processes nodes in a flow. So perhaps I need to structure it so that after finding both items, their values are available for multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a Map function to find the first even and odd, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother approach: Use two separate For loops, each iterating through the list once to find the first even and odd.

Well, as per the problem statement, it's assumed that both exist, so perhaps we don't need error handling here.\n\nNow, in Midio, each Find node will return an item if found. So I can connect these to a multiplication node.\n\nBut looking at the function signature, the output is a single number property. So I'll have to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me sketch out the code:\n\n- Create two instances of Iteration.Find.\n   - The first for even numbers.\n   - The second for odd numbers.\n- Connect both Find nodes to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will process the entire list. So if I have a long list, it might be inefficient, but for the scope of this problem, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single For loop to iterate through the list once and capture both the first even and odd numbers as they are encountered would be more efficient. But that requires more complex logic with variables and conditions.\n\nLet me consider which approach is better in Midio.\n\nUsing two Find nodes might be straightforward but could process the list twice, which isn't ideal for large lists. However, it's simpler to implement.\n\nAlternatively, using a single For loop:\n\n- Initialize variables to hold the first even and odd.\n- Iterate through each item.\n   - If an even is found and not yet captured, store it.\n   - Similarly for odd.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop early.\n\nBut Midio's node-based approach might make this more complex. I'd need to manage state variables, which could involve using a Count or other looping constructs.\n\nHmm, perhaps for simplicity and given that the list isn't expected to be extremely large, using two Find nodes is acceptable.\n\nSo, let me proceed with two Find nodes.\n\nNow, in Midio code:\n\n- Create an instance of Iteration.Find for even numbers.\n   - The handler function checks if the item is even.\n- Another instance for odd numbers.\n   - Handler checks for odd.\n- Connect both found items to Math.Mul.\n- Output the result.\n\nWait, but each Find node will process the entire list. So in Midio, I can chain them or use some logic to ensure they don't interfere with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a single For loop and within it, check for even and odd as we go.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this:\n\n- Use Std.For to iterate over each item.\n   - On each iteration, check if the current item is even or odd.\n   - If first_even hasn't been found yet, store it when an even is encountered.\n   - Similarly for first_odd.\n   - Once both are found, perhaps break out of the loop.\n\nBut Midio's For loop doesn't have a built-in way to break early. So this might require more nodes and flags.\n\nAlternatively, I can use two separate Find nodes as initially thought.\n\nLet me proceed with that approach.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create a Find node for even numbers.\n   - Predicate: it % 2 == 0\n- Another Find node for odd numbers.\n   - Predicate: it % 2 != 0\n- Connect both to Math.Mul.\n\nBut wait, the output of each Find is an item. So I can connect them as inputs to a Math.Mul node.\n\nWait, but in Midio, functions like Math.Mul take two inputs: first and second. So I can connect the even result to first and odd result to second.\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The function takes a list.\n- Two Find nodes process this list to find the first even and odd.\n- Multiply these two numbers.\n- Output the product.\n\nNow, let me structure this in Midio code.\n\nI'll need:\n\n1. An instance of Iteration.Find for evens.\n2. Another for odds.\n3. A Math.Mul node.\n4. Connect both Find nodes to their respective inputs of Math.Mul.\n5. The output of Math.Mul is the result.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each Find node needs to be triggered and have its items set.\n\nSo I'll connect the list to both Find nodes' items.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\n- Create two Iteration.Find instances: find_even and find_odd.\n   - Both take the input list as their items.\n   - Their predicates are \"it %",

So I need to connect the found items from both Find nodes into a single multiplication operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use variables to store the first even and odd numbers as they are found during iteration.\n\nHmm, maybe using a For loop would be better here because it allows me to process each item step by step and keep track of whether I've found an even or odd number yet.\n\nLet's consider using a For loop:\n\n- Initialize two variables: first_even and first_odd, both set to null.\n- Iterate through each item in the list:\n   - If the current item is even and first_even is null, assign it to first_even.\n   - If the current item is odd and first_odd is null, assign it to first_odd.\n   - Once both are found, break out of the loop or continue until the end.\n\nBut Midio doesn't have variables in the traditional sense. Instead, we can use setters and getters to manage state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using two separate For loops: one for even and one for odd, but that might not be efficient as it would process the list twice.\n\nWait, maybe I can first find the first even number, then with the remaining elements, find the first odd. But that's still processing the list in parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to use two Find nodes on the same list, each looking for their respective condition.\n\nLet me try this:\n\n1. **Find First Even**:\n   - Use Iteration.Find with predicate \"it % 2 == 0\".\n   - Connect the list to this node.\n   - The found item will be available through its output.\n\n2. **Find First Odd**:\n   - Another Iteration.Find with predicate \"it % 2 != 0\".\n   - Same list as input.\n   - Output the found item.\n\n3. **Multiply the Two Results**:\n   - Use Math.Mul, connecting both outputs to it.\n   - The result will be the product.\n\nBut wait, in Midio, each node can only have one output. So I need to connect both items into a single multiplication operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use an IfExpression to check if both are found and then multiply them.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the case where either is not found? Since the problem assumes they exist, maybe it's safe to proceed.\n\nSo in code:\n\n- Create two Find nodes.\n   - First: predicate \"it % 2 == 0\".\n   - Second: predicate \"it % 2 != 0\".\n- Connect both to a Math.Mul node.\n- The output of Math.Mul is the desired product.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio allows connecting multiple inputs directly into Math.Mul. Looking back at the available functions, Math.Mul takes two inputs: first and second.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- The first Find's item is connected to Math.Mul.first.\n- The second Find's item is connected to Math.Mul.second.\n- The result of Math.Mul is the output.\n\nBut I need to ensure that both items are available before multiplying. Since the list is processed in order, the first even and odd may be found correctly.\n\nWait, but what if the first element is even? Then find_even will get it, and find_odd will look for the next odd number after that point. But no, because each Find starts from the beginning of the list.\n\nNo, actually, each Find node processes the entire list until it finds the first occurrence. So both Find nodes would process the entire list independently, which is inefficient but works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can optimize by processing the list once and capturing both values in a single pass using"
