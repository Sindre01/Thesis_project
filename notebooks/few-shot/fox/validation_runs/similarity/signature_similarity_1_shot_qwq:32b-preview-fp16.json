                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. So, if one is positive and the other is negative, it should return true; otherwise, false. I need to make sure that this works correctly for any integer values, including zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to have opposite signs. If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. However, if both are positive or both are negative, they do not have opposite signs. Also, if either or both of the numbers are zero, since zero is neither positive nor negative, I need to decide how to handle that case.\n\nIn most programming contexts, zero is considered non-negative. So, if one number is zero and the other is positive, they don't have opposite signs. Similarly, if one is zero and the other is negative, they don't have opposite signs. If both are zero, they obviously don't have opposite signs.\n\nSo, my function needs to return true only when one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nNow, how can I implement this in Midio? I need to use the available external functions to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions, I see that there are mathematical and logical operations available. Specifically, there's a \"Math.Expression\" function that can evaluate expressions like \"a < 0 && b >= 0\" or similar conditions.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to multiply the two numbers. If the product is negative, then they have opposite signs. If the product is positive, they have the same sign. If the product is zero, then at least one of them is zero.\n\nWait, but multiplication can overflow if the numbers are very large in magnitude. Although in Midio, I assume that number types can handle large values, but still, it's something to consider.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the sign of each number individually and then see if they are different.\n\nIn programming terms, for integers, the sign can be checked using comparison operators. For example, if x < 0, it's negative; if x >= 0, it's non-negative.\n\nSo, I can check if (x < 0 && y >= 0) || (x >= 0 && y < 0). If this condition is true, then the numbers have opposite signs.\n\nIn Midio, I can use logical operators to construct this condition.\n\nLooking at the external functions, there's \"Logic.And\" and \"Logic.Or\" that can be used to combine conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up two \"Logic.And\" instances:\n\n1. One with (x < 0) and (y >= 0)\n\n2. Another with (x >= 0) and (y < 0)\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Or\" to combine the results of these two \"And\" operations.\n\nBut to check if x < 0, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" function, and similarly for y >= 0 using \"Math.GreaterThanOrEqual\".\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Maybe it's \"Math.LessThan\"?\n\nActually, in the list provided, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Hmm.\n\nWait, here's \"Math.LessThan\": \"Checks if 'left' is less than 'right'\"\n\nYes, there is \"Math.LessThan\".\n\nSo, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" for x < 0 and \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\" for y >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition.\n\nSo, let's sketch this out.\n\nI need:\n\n- Check if x < 0 (using Math.LessThan with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y >= 0 (using Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Check if x >= 0 (Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y < 0 (Math.LessThan with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nThen, combine the two \"And\" results with \"Logic.Or\" to get the final output.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the case when either x or y is zero.\n\nIf x is zero and y is positive, then (x >= 0 && y < 0) is false, and (x < 0 && y >= 0) is false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if both are zero, both conditions are false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nIf x is positive and y is negative, one condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nIf x is negative and y is positive, the other condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nSeems good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplication approach:\n\nMultiply x and y, and check if the result is negative.\n\nBut this might have issues with overflow for large integers, although in Midio, numbers might be handled differently.\n\nAlso, multiplying two large numbers could be less efficient than simple comparisons.\n\nSo, stick with the comparison-based approach.\n\nNow, to implement this in Midio, I need to set up the instances accordingly.\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\nI need to create instances for:\n\n- Math.LessThan for x < 0\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for y >= 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nSimilarly for the other condition:\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for x >= 0\n\n- Math.LessThan for y < 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nThen, Logic.Or to combine the two And results.\n\nFinally, connect the output to the output property.\n\nI need to make sure that the connections are correct, i.e., the outputs of the conditions are connected to the Logic.And inputs, and the outputs of the Logic.And instances are connected to the Logic.Or inputs, and finally, the Logic.Or output is connected to the final output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the input properties x and y are connected to the respective Math functions.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out in code format.\n\nFirst, import the standard library:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the function, create the instances.\n\nInstance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: some_x, y: some_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, in Midio, instance connections are made via arrows, and properties are connected.\n\nSo, actually, I need to define instances and connect their inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's try.\n\nFirst, create an instance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThan_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThan_x.right\n\nSimilarly, for y >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, actually, for y >= 0, it's y >= 0, so left: y, right: 0\n\nThen, connect y_5390f5 to lessThanOrEqual_y.left\n\nAnd constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_y.right\n\nThen, create a Logic.And instance to combine these two:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) and1 root.Std_k98ojb.Logic.And {\n\nin1: lessThan_x.result\n\nin2: lessThanOrEqual_y.result\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition:\n\nx >= 0 and y < 0\n\nSo, x >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThanOrEqual_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_x.right\n\nAnd y < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect y_5390f5 to less"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function should take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero.\n\nSo, for example, take the number 121:\n\n- Positions are counted from left to right, starting with position 1 as odd.\n\n- Digits: 1 (position 1, odd), 2 (position 2, even), 1 (position 3, odd).\n\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum of digits in even positions: 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example, number 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even), 9 (odd)\n\n- Sum odd: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum even: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n1. Take an input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n3. Iterate through each digit, keeping track of whether its position is odd or even.\n\n4. Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\n7. Output true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI need to implement this logic using Midio nodes. I'll likely need nodes for string manipulation, math operations, loops, and conditionals.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n- First, I need to convert the number to a string so I can iterate through each digit.\n\n- Then, I need to iterate through each character in the string, determining its position (odd or even).\n\n- For each digit, add it to the appropriate sum (odd or even).\n\n- After processing all digits, calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- Finally, check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers. The divisibility rule should work the same way regardless of the sign, so I can take the absolute value of the number before processing.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the input is zero. Zero is divisible by any non-zero number, including 11, so the function should return true for n=0.\n\nLet me outline the steps again, considering edge cases:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number to handle negatives.\n\n2. Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.\n\n3. Initialize two sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. Determine the position (odd or even based on index).\n\nb. Convert the character to a number.\n\nc. Add to the appropriate sum based on position.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the sums of odd and even positions.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11:\n\na. If the difference modulo 11 is 0, then it's divisible.\n\n7. Output true if divisible, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in programming, the modulo operator can be used to check divisibility. If a number modulo 11 equals zero, then it's divisible by 11.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the difference is divisible by 11, which includes negative differences, but since I'm taking the absolute value earlier, all differences should be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Midio:\n\n- I'll need a node to convert the number to a string.\n\n- A loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n\n- Conditionals to determine if the position is odd or even.\n\n- Math nodes to sum the digits accordingly.\n\n- A node to calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- A node to check if this difference is divisible by 11 using the modulo operation.\n\nI should also consider the efficiency, but since we're dealing with numbers that have a reasonable number of digits, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram of the nodes:\n\n- Start with the input number.\n\n- Connect to an \"absolute value\" math node.\n\n- Connect to a \"toString\" conversion node.\n\n- Connect to a \"split string\" node to get an array of characters.\n\n- Connect to a \"for each\" loop node.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get the index and character.\n\n- Determine if the index is odd or even.\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Add to odd sum or even sum based on position.\n\n- After the loop, subtract even sum from odd sum.\n\n- Take the absolute value of the difference.\n\n- Use modulo operator with 11.\n\n- Check if the result is 0.\n\n- Output true if yes, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the divisibility rule, we take the difference between sums of digits in odd and even positions, and check if that difference is divisible by 11. It's not necessary to take the absolute value of the difference because zero is considered divisible, and negative numbers are also considered divisible if their positive counterparts are.\n\nSo, in the modulo operation, both positive and negative differences that are multiples of 11 will yield zero.\n\nBut in programming, the modulo operator for negative numbers can behave differently depending on the language. In some languages, -11 modulo 11 is 0, but I need to confirm how Midio handles this.\n\nTo be safe, I can take the absolute value of the difference before applying the modulo operation.\n\nAlso, considering that the input can be a floating-point number, but for divisibility rules, we typically deal with integers. So, I should ensure that the input is an integer. If it's a float, I might need to truncate or round it to an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a number,\" not necessarily an integer. However, divisibility by 11 is generally defined for integers. So, I'll assume that the input is an integer.\n\nI should add a check to ensure that the input is an integer, and if not, perhaps round it to the nearest integer or return an error.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me also consider the case when the input is zero, as mentioned earlier. Zero should return true.\n\nAnother consideration is the sign of the number. Since divisibility is not affected by the sign, I can ignore the sign by taking the absolute value.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string.\n\n3. Split the string into an array of characters.\n\n4. Initialize two variables: sumOdd and sumEven to zero.\n\n5. Iterate through the array with indices:\n\na. For each character, convert it back to a number.\n\nb. If the index is odd, add to sumOdd; if even, add to sumEven.\n\n6. Calculate difference = sumOdd - sumEven.\n\n7. Compute abs(difference) % 11.\n\n8. If the result is zero, output true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in programming, array indices usually start at 0, which is even. But in our position count, we considered position 1 as odd.\n\nSo, to match positions:\n\n- Index 0 in the array corresponds to position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 corresponds to position 2 (even).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\n- For each character at index i:\n\n- If i is even (0, 2, 4,...), it's in an odd position.\n\n- If i is odd (1, 3, 5,...), it's in an even position.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nIn programming, array indices start at 0.\n\nBut positions in the number start at 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Character at index 0 is position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 is position 2 (even).\n\n- Index 2 is position 3 (odd).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, to determine if a position is odd or even:\n\n- If the index is even, position is odd.\n\n- If the index is odd, position is even.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, it's an odd position.\n\n- Else, even position.\n\nWait, but in programming terms:\n\n- Index 0 (even index) corresponds to odd position.\n\n- Index 1 (odd index) corresponds to even position.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the loop, I need to check if the index is even or odd to determine the position.\n\nNow, in Midio, how do I iterate through a string with indices?\n\nI think there's a way to get both the index and the value in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the string to an array of characters and iterate through it with indices.\n\nAssuming Midio has a \"for each with index\" loop, I can use that"

From the list provided, I see nodes for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and control flow.\n\nFirst, to convert the number to a string, I can use the \"Strings.ToString\" node, but it's not listed in the provided external functions. Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for getting the last digit, and \"Math.Div\" for removing the last digit.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- Use \"Math.Mod\" with 10 to get the last digit.\n\n- Add or subtract the digit from an accumulating sum, alternating signs.\n\n- Use \"Math.Div\" by 10 to remove the last digit.\n\n- Continue until the number is zero.\n\n- Finally, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if it's zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a predefined number of iterations, which in this case is not known in advance because it depends on the number of digits in the input number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach or a while-loop-like structure.\n\nLooking at the nodes provided, \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit here. Maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nAnother idea: since the number of digits is finite, I can assume a maximum number of digits and loop that many times, but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to implement a while-loop in Midio. Perhaps \"Std.For\" can be adapted for this purpose.\n\nUpon closer inspection, \"Std.For\" has inputs for \"items\", \"execute\", \"reset\", etc., but it's designed for iterating over a list of items, not for condition-based looping.\n\nMaybe I need to use a combination of nodes to create a loop that continues until the number is zero.\n\nPerhaps I can use a \"Std.While\" node if it exists, but it's not in the provided list. Maybe I need to simulate a while-loop using other nodes.\n\nLet me think about using recursion. I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nBut Midio seems to be a node-based visual programming language, and recursion might not be straightforward or efficient.\n\nAnother approach: convert the number to a string, split it into digits, and then process each digit with a loop.\n\nSince string manipulation nodes are available, this might be feasible.\n\nLooking back, perhaps converting to a string is a reasonable approach in Midio.\n\nSo, here's an updated plan:\n\n1. Convert the input number to a string.\n\n2. Split the string into individual characters (digits).\n\n3. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each digit.\n\n4. Convert each character back to a number.\n\n5. Alternate adding and subtracting these numbers to compute the alternating sum.\n\n6. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, let's look at the specific nodes I might need:\n\n- \"Strings.ToString\" to convert the number to a string.\n\n- \"Strings.Split\" to split the string into characters.\n\n- \"Std.For\" to iterate over the list of characters.\n\n- \"Strings.ToNumber\" to convert each character back to a number.\n\n- \"Math.Add\" and \"Math.Subtract\" to compute the alternating sum.\n\n- \"Math.Mod\" to check if the sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Strings.ToString\" and \"Strings.Split\" are not in the provided list of external functions. I need to confirm which nodes are available.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- Std: likely includes standard utilities like loops, conditions, etc.\n\n- Http: for HTTP requests, probably not needed here.\n\nI need to see if there are string manipulation nodes available under \"Std\" or another module.\n\nPerhaps I need to import a string utility module if it exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get the digits without converting to a string, using mathematical operations.\n\nLet me consider the mathematical approach again:\n\n- Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sign (start with addition).\n\n- While the number is greater than zero:\n\n- Get the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Multiply it by the current sign (+1 or -1).\n\n- Add it to the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number using \"Math.Div\" with 10.\n\n- Flip the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11.\n\nThis seems doable with mathematical nodes.\n\nI need to implement a loop that continues until the number is zero. Since \"Std.For\" is designed for iterating over items, not for condition-based loops, I might need to simulate a while-loop.\n\nOne way to simulate a while-loop is to use recursion or to use a loop node that can be conditioned to continue based on a certain predicate.\n\nUpon further thought, perhaps I can use \"Std.While\" if it's available, even if it's not listed in the provided external functions. I should check the documentation or the list again to confirm.\n\nWait, the provided external functions include \"Std.For\", which might be adaptable for this purpose.\n\nLet me consider using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range to cover the maximum number of digits possible in the input number.\n\nFor example, if the input number is less than 10^18 (a common limit), then it has at most 18 digits. So, I can set \"Std.For\" to iterate 18 times, and inside the loop, process each digit if it exists.\n\nBut this seems a bit hacky. A better way would be to conditionally exit the loop when the number is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a state machine approach, where the loop continues as long as the number is not zero.\n\nGiven that \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit for this, maybe I need to think of another way.\n\nLet me consider using recursion by creating a sub-module that calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nIn Midio, it's possible to create recursive modules, but it might be complicated for this task.\n\nAnother idea: use a \"Std.While\" node if it's available. Although it's not in the provided list, perhaps it's implicitly available or can be simulated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use triggers and connections to create a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for the current context. Perhaps I should stick with the mathematical approach using \"Std.For\" with a fixed number of iterations, assuming the input number has fewer than, say, 20 digits.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Set up \"Std.For\" to iterate 20 times.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Check if the number is zero. If so, exit the loop.\n\n- Otherwise, process the last digit.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n\n-"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array. The function should take a list of numbers as input and return their sum. I need to make sure that it handles different types of lists, including empty lists, and that it correctly sums up the elements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle lists in Midio. From the external functions provided, I see there are several list manipulation functions like List.Length, List.Contains, List.Sort, etc. But for summing up the elements, I might need to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum.\n\nLooking at the Iteration.Map and Iteration.Reduce functions, it seems that Iteration.Reduce could be particularly useful here because it allows me to accumulate a value by applying a function to each element of the list.\n\nSo, my plan is to use Iteration.Reduce to iterate through the list, adding each element to an accumulator starting from 0. This should give me the sum of all elements in the list.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up in Midio. I'll need to create a reduce function that takes the list as input and specifies a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulated sum.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the sum should be 0. I'm not sure how Iteration.Reduce handles empty lists, so I might need to check if the list is empty beforehand and handle that separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Iteration.Reduce can handle empty lists by just returning the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nLet me look up the documentation for Iteration.Reduce:\n\n\"Reduces the list `item` using the provided reducer function, which is expected to accept 2-4 inputs, the first being the accumulated value, and the second the value being accumulated. A third optional input will contain the current index, while the fourth optional input will contain the context input.\"\n\nOkay, so it seems like I can provide a reducer function that takes at least two inputs: the accumulator and the current element.\n\nI need to make sure that when the list is empty, the reduce function returns the initial value, which should be 0 in this case.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set the initial value of the accumulator to 0, and then for each element in the list, add it to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create an instance of Iteration.Reduce, provide the list and the reducer function, and specify the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nI'll also need to define the reducer function. Since Midio is a node-based language, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n2. Connect the input list to the 'items' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n3. Define a reducer function that takes two inputs: accumulator and current element, and outputs their sum.\n\n4. Connect this reducer function to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n5. Set the initial value of the accumulator to 0.\n\n6. The result of Iteration.Reduce will be the sum of the list, which I can output.\n\nAlso, I should consider what happens if the list contains non-numeric elements. Since this is a sum function for numbers, I need to ensure that only numeric elements are summed. Maybe I should add a check in the reducer function to ignore non-numeric elements.\n\nBut for simplicity, and assuming that the list contains only numbers, I'll proceed without adding extra checks.\n\nLet me consider writing some pseudocode first:\n\nfunction sum(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 0\n\nelse:\n\ninitialize accumulator to 0\n\nfor each element in list:\n\naccumulator += element\n\nreturn accumulator\n\nIn Midio, this would translate to using Iteration.Reduce with an initial value of 0 and a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based syntax.\n\nI need to create a function called \"_sum\" with an input property \"list\" of type List and an output property \"sum\" of type Number.\n\nInside this function, I'll instantiate Iteration.Reduce, define the reducer function, set the initial accumulator value, and connect everything appropriately.\n\nI also need to make sure that the function handles empty lists correctly, returning 0 in that case.\n\nLet me consider how to define the reducer function. Since Midio is node-based, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows inline expressions or lambda functions, I could define the reducer directly.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, I see Math.Add, which takes two numbers and returns their sum. Maybe I can use Math.Add directly as the reducer function, with the accumulator and current element as inputs.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes the accumulator and current element and returns the new accumulator value, which is exactly what Math.Add does if the accumulator and current element are numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use Math.Add as the reducer function directly.\n\nLet me think about this: if I connect Math.Add to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce, with the accumulator connected to 'first' and the current element connected to 'second', then Iteration.Reduce should correctly sum up the list.\n\nI need to confirm whether Iteration.Reduce can directly use Math.Add in this manner.\n\nAssuming that's possible, my setup would be:\n\n- Instance of Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Connect 'items' to the input list\n\n- Set 'initial_value' to 0\n\n- Connect 'reducer' to Math.Add\n\n- The result of Iteration.Reduce would be the sum, which I can output.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to ensure that if the list is empty, Iteration.Reduce returns the initial value, which is 0, as expected.\n\nI should also consider performance, but for now, since this is likely an internal operation, I won't worry about optimizing it further.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio's syntax.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module and the sum function:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {\n\nin(x: -213, y: 28, name: \"list\") property(List) list_2c62ab\n\nout(x: 567, y: 3, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_2a848f\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 100, y: 100) reduce_e4a7b3 root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\nitems: list_2c62ab\n\ninitial_value: 0\n\nreducer: add_c5f3d1\n\n}\n\ninstance(x: 200, y: 100) add_c5f3d1 root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\n\n\nreduce_e4a7b3.result -> sum_2a848f\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the reducer function takes two inputs: accumulator and current element.\n\nIn Midio, functions might require specific input connections.\n\nLooking at Math.Add, it takes 'first' and 'second' inputs and produces a 'result'.\n\nSo, in the context of Iteration.Reduce, I need to map the accumulator to 'first' and the current element to 'second'.\n\nI'm not sure if simply assigning 'reducer: add_c5f3d1' is sufficient. Maybe I need to specify how the inputs are connected.\n\nPerhaps I need to use a higher-order function or specify the connections more explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Iteration.Reduce automatically wires the accumulator and current element to the reducer's inputs.\n\nI need to check the documentation for Iteration.Reduce to understand how to connect the reducer function.\n\nAssuming that Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes two inputs (accumulator and current element), and outputs the new accumulator value, then connecting Math.Add directly should work, as it adds two numbers and produces a sum.\n\nSo, in this case, the accumulator would be the first input to Math.Add, and the current element would be the second input.\n\nThe output of Math.Add would be the new accumulator value.\n\nThis seems correct for summing up a list.\n\nNow, to handle empty lists, I set the initial_value to 0, so if the list is empty, the result should be 0.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nLet me consider testing this function with some example lists:\n\n- [1, 2, 3] should return 6\n\n- [10, 20, 30] should return 60\n\n- [] should return 0\n\n- [5] should return 5\n\nI can mentally verify that the reduce operation with Math.Add and initial value 0 would produce these results.\n\nI don't think I need to handle cases where the list contains non-numeric elements, as per the task description, but if needed, I could add additional checks.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with this implementation.\n\nLet me write the Midio code accordingly.\n\n\nTo create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array, you can use the `Iteration.Reduce` function along with `Math.Add`. Here's how you can structure your code:\n\n```midio\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nmodule() main {\n\n    func(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {"

The function will take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1.

Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for modulo operation, \"Math.Div\" for division, and \"Math.Sub\" for subtraction.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- In each iteration, calculate the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Add or subtract this digit from the alternating sum based on the current sign.\n\n- Remove the last digit by integer division of the number by 10.\n\n- Alternate the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a list or a range to iterate over, which might not be directly applicable here since I need to iterate based on the number of digits in the number.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of digits first and then use \"Std.For\" to loop that many times.\n\nTo find the number of digits, I can convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, string conversion is not straightforward.\n\nAnother mathematical way to find the number of digits is to use logarithms, but I'm not sure if Midio has logarithm functions.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a while loop, where I keep processing the number until it becomes zero, similar to the steps I outlined earlier.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, there is no direct \"while\" loop, but I can simulate it using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range and early exit conditions.\n\nHowever, this might be inefficient. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use recursion to process each digit one by one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursive function calls.\n\nLet me consider another approach: since the number can be large, but for practical purposes, let's assume it's within the integer range that Midio handles.\n\nI'll proceed with the loop approach using \"Std.For\" and handle the digits one by one.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Determine the number of digits in the input number.\n\n- As mentioned earlier, this can be done by converting to a string and getting its length, but since string conversion is not straightforward, I'll look for an alternative.\n\n- Alternatively, I can use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it becomes zero, counting the number of iterations. This will give me the number of digits.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate from 0 to the number of digits minus one.\n\n3. In each iteration:\n\na. Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\nb. Depending on the position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n4. After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's consider how to implement step 1: finding the number of digits.\n\nI'll need to create a counter that increments each time the number is divided by 10 until it becomes zero.\n\nThis can be done using another \"Std.For\" loop with a large range and an early exit condition, but this might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a function that calculates the number of digits mathematically without looping, but without logarithms, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a lookup table for the number of digits based on the range of the number, but that seems overly complicated.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the number of digits is less than, say, 20, and use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range up to 20, and handle cases where the number has fewer digits.\n\nSo, in the main function, I'll have:\n\n- An input property for the number.\n\n- An output property for the boolean result.\n\n- Instances of various nodes to perform the required operations.\n\nLet me start by defining the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"finds whether a number is divisible by 11.\") is_diff {\n\nin(x: 5, y: -25, name: \"n\") property(Number) n_27f29c\n\nout(x: 668, y: 2, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_f2630f\n\n}\n\nNow, within this function, I need to implement the logic.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of digits in 'n'. Since direct string conversion isn't straightforward, I'll use a loop to count the digits.\n\nI can use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range, say 20 iterations, and in each iteration, check if the number is still greater than zero. If it is, increment the digit count and divide the number by 10.\n\nBut since \"Std.For\" iterates over a list or range, and I need to exit early when the number becomes zero, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can always iterate 20 times and ignore iterations beyond the actual number of digits.\n\nProceeding with this approach:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\n- Add or subtract it from the alternating sum based on the position.\n\n- Accumulate the alternating sum.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Iteration.Map\" is typically for transforming lists, not for accumulating a value.\n\nMaybe I need to use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to accumulate the alternating sum.\n\nLooking back at the provided nodes, I see \"Iteration.Aggregate\", which might be suitable for accumulating a value.\n\nBut to use \"Iteration.Aggregate\", I need to provide an initial value and a function that combines the accumulator with each element of the list.\n\nIn this case, the list would be the digits of the number, but since I don't have a straightforward way to get the digits as a list, I need to generate them within the aggregate function.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use a recursive function where I process one digit at a time and pass the accumulated sum and the remaining number to the next recursion.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursion.\n\nGiven these constraints, maybe it's simpler to proceed with the initial plan of using \"Std.For\" with a fixed range and ignoring extra iterations.\n\nHere's how it could work:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the last digit of 'n' using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Depending on the current position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to return a list that contains elements which are unique to each list, meaning elements that are not shared between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are in A but not in B, combined with those that are in B but not in A. Essentially, it's the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A - B) \u222a (B - A).\n\nMidio seems to have some set operations available, like Sets.Difference. Maybe I can use that to find the differences and then combine them.\n\nLet me look at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Sets.Difference: Returns the difference of two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\n\n- List.Concat: Concatenates two lists.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the difference of list1 minus list2, and then the difference of list2 minus list1, and then concatenate those two differences to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to handle that appropriately. Maybe I should treat the lists as sets, so duplicates are ignored.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists,\" and it doesn't specify whether duplicates should be considered or not. Perhaps I should assume that duplicates are possible in the lists, and the output should include duplicates appropriately.\n\nFor example, if list1 is [1, 2, 2, 3] and list2 is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4]. Notice that 2 appears twice in list1, but in the symmetric difference, it appears once because it's present in both lists.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if my understanding of handling duplicates is correct. In set theory, sets don't have duplicates, so symmetric difference doesn't consider multiples. But since we're dealing with lists, which can have duplicates, perhaps the output should reflect the counts appropriately.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of list operations rather than set operations.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nlist1: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nlist2: [2, 3, 4]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be elements that are unique to each list.\n\nSo, elements in list1 not in list2: [1, 2]\n\nElements in list2 not in list1: [4]\n\nThen, combining these: [1, 2, 4]\n\nBut in list1, 2 appears twice, but in list2, 2 appears only once. So, the dissimilar elements should have one 2, because one 2 is shared.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother way is to compute the union of the two lists and then remove the intersection. That would give me the elements that are not common to both lists.\n\nSo, union(A, B) - intersection(A, B)\n\nThat's another way to compute the symmetric difference.\n\nBut in Midio, I need to find instances or functions that can compute union and intersection.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions:\n\n- Sets.Intersection: Returns the intersection of two input lists.\n\n- List.Union: Not listed, so maybe not available?\n\nIf List.Union is not available, I might need to implement union using other operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Sets.Difference function twice and then concatenate the results.\n\nSo, (list1 - intersection(list1, list2)) concatenated with (list2 - intersection(list1, list2))\n\nThat should give me the symmetric difference.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI need to create a function called find_dissimilar with two inputs: list1 and list2 of type List, and an output output of type List.\n\nInside the function, I'll need to:\n\n1. Compute the intersection of list1 and list2.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list1 minus the intersection.\n\n3. Compute the difference of list2 minus the intersection.\n\n4. Concatenate the results of step 2 and step 3 to get the final output.\n\nSo, I'll need three instances: two Sets.Difference and one List.Concat.\n\nAlso, one Sets.Intersection to find the common elements.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Instance intersection (Sets.Intersection) with left connected to list1 and right connected to list2.\n\n- Instance difference1 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list1 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance difference2 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list2 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance concat (List.Concat) with left connected to difference1.difference and right connected to difference2.difference.\n\n- Connect concat.list to output.\n\nThis should give me the symmetric difference of list1 and list2.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more efficient way or if there are built-in functions that can do this in fewer steps.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, there's no direct symmetric difference function, so this seems like the way to go.\n\nI should also think about the types of the lists. Are they lists of integers, strings, or any type? Midio seems to have a generic List type, so perhaps it can handle any type.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the lists contain comparable elements, whatever that means in Midio.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the Sets.Difference and Sets.Intersection functions handle duplicates appropriately.\n\nIf Sets.Difference removes all occurrences of elements in right from left, then that might affect the handling of duplicates.\n\nI need to consider whether duplicates should be preserved or not in the output.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the simplest approach is to treat the lists as sets, ignoring duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Midio's Sets functions already handle this.\n\nI should check the documentation for Sets.Difference and Sets.Intersection to see how they handle duplicates.\n\nLooking back, the documentation says:\n\n- Sets.Intersection: Returns the intersection of the two input lists, left and right, through the intersect output.\n\n- Sets.Difference: Returns the difference of the two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\n\nIt doesn't specify how duplicates are handled. Maybe I need to assume that duplicates are removed in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Lists in Midio can have duplicates, and Sets operations work differently.\n\nWait, the node names suggest \"Sets\", which implies no duplicates, but the input lists might have duplicates.\n\nI need to think about how to handle duplicates based on the behavior of the Sets operations.\n\nTo simplify, I'll assume that Sets operations in Midio handle duplicates appropriately for set operations, meaning that duplicates are ignored.\n\nSo, intersection would return unique common elements, and difference would remove any elements present in both, regardless of duplicates.\n\nThen, concatenating the differences should give me the symmetric difference without duplicates.\n\nBut if the input lists have duplicates, those duplicates might appear in the output, which might not be ideal.\n\nPerhaps I need to decide whether to preserve duplicates or not based on the problem requirements.\n\nSince the problem says \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists,\" and it doesn't specify how to handle duplicates, I'll proceed with the set-based approach, ignoring duplicates.\n\nSo, using Sets.Intersection and Sets.Difference should work for this purpose.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to create a function called find_dissimilar with two inputs: list1 and list2, both of type List, and one output output of type List.\n\nInside the function, I'll place the necessary instances connected appropriately.\n\nLet me write down the code structure.\n\nFirst, import the standard library or whatever is necessary.\n\nThen, define the module main.\n\nInside main, define the function find_dissimilar with the specified inputs and output.\n\nInside the function, create instances of Sets.Intersection, two Sets.Difference, and one List.Concat, and connect them as described earlier.\n\nFinally, export the function if necessary.\n\nWait, looking back at the signature provided:\n\n\"func(doc: \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\") find_dissimilar {\n\nin(x: -531, y: 2, name: \"list1\") property(List) list1_ai\n\nin(x: -165, y: 68, name: \"list2\") property(List) list2_ai\n\nout(x: 340, y: 77, name: \"output\") property(List) output_ai\n\n}\"\n\nSo, the inputs and output have specific names and positions.\n\nI need to match those in my function definition.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the instance names and connections are correct.\n\nLet me try to write this step by step.\n\nFirst, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\") find_dissimilar {\n\nin(x: -531, y: 2, name: \"list1\") property(List) list1_ai\n\nin(x: -165, y: 68, name: \"list2\") property(List) list2_ai\n\nout(x: 340, y: 77, name: \"output\") property(List) output_ai\n\n}\n\n}\n\nThen"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. So, if one is positive and the other is negative, it should return true; otherwise, false. I need to make sure that this works correctly for any integer values, including zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to have opposite signs. If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. However, if both are positive or both are negative, they do not have opposite signs. Also, if either or both of the numbers are zero, since zero is neither positive nor negative, I need to decide how to handle that case.\n\nIn most programming contexts, zero is considered non-negative. So, if one number is zero and the other is positive, they don't have opposite signs. Similarly, if one is zero and the other is negative, they don't have opposite signs. If both are zero, they obviously don't have opposite signs.\n\nSo, my function needs to return true only when one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nNow, how can I implement this in Midio? I need to use the available external functions to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions, I see that there are mathematical and logical operations available. Specifically, there's a \"Math.Expression\" function that can evaluate expressions like \"a < 0 && b >= 0\" or similar conditions.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to multiply the two numbers. If the product is negative, then they have opposite signs. If the product is positive, they have the same sign. If the product is zero, then at least one of them is zero.\n\nWait, but multiplication can overflow if the numbers are very large in magnitude. Although in Midio, I assume that number types can handle large values, but still, it's something to consider.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the sign of each number individually and then see if they are different.\n\nIn programming terms, for integers, the sign can be checked using comparison operators. For example, if x < 0, it's negative; if x >= 0, it's non-negative.\n\nSo, I can check if (x < 0 && y >= 0) || (x >= 0 && y < 0). If this condition is true, then the numbers have opposite signs.\n\nIn Midio, I can use logical operators to construct this condition.\n\nLooking at the external functions, there's \"Logic.And\" and \"Logic.Or\" that can be used to combine conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up two \"Logic.And\" instances:\n\n1. One with (x < 0) and (y >= 0)\n\n2. Another with (x >= 0) and (y < 0)\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Or\" to combine the results of these two \"And\" operations.\n\nBut to check if x < 0, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" function, and similarly for y >= 0 using \"Math.GreaterThanOrEqual\".\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Maybe it's \"Math.LessThan\"?\n\nActually, in the list provided, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Hmm.\n\nWait, here's \"Math.LessThan\": \"Checks if 'left' is less than 'right'\"\n\nYes, there is \"Math.LessThan\".\n\nSo, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" for x < 0 and \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\" for y >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition.\n\nSo, let's sketch this out.\n\nI need:\n\n- Check if x < 0 (using Math.LessThan with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y >= 0 (using Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Check if x >= 0 (Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y < 0 (Math.LessThan with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nThen, combine the two \"And\" results with \"Logic.Or\" to get the final output.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the case when either x or y is zero.\n\nIf x is zero and y is positive, then (x >= 0 && y < 0) is false, and (x < 0 && y >= 0) is false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if both are zero, both conditions are false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nIf x is positive and y is negative, one condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nIf x is negative and y is positive, the other condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nSeems good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplication approach:\n\nMultiply x and y, and check if the result is negative.\n\nBut this might have issues with overflow for large integers, although in Midio, numbers might be handled differently.\n\nAlso, multiplying two large numbers could be less efficient than simple comparisons.\n\nSo, stick with the comparison-based approach.\n\nNow, to implement this in Midio, I need to set up the instances accordingly.\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\nI need to create instances for:\n\n- Math.LessThan for x < 0\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for y >= 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nSimilarly for the other condition:\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for x >= 0\n\n- Math.LessThan for y < 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nThen, Logic.Or to combine the two And results.\n\nFinally, connect the output to the output property.\n\nI need to make sure that the connections are correct, i.e., the outputs of the conditions are connected to the Logic.And inputs, and the outputs of the Logic.And instances are connected to the Logic.Or inputs, and finally, the Logic.Or output is connected to the final output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the input properties x and y are connected to the respective Math functions.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out in code format.\n\nFirst, import the standard library:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the function, create the instances.\n\nInstance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: some_x, y: some_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, in Midio, instance connections are made via arrows, and properties are connected.\n\nSo, actually, I need to define instances and connect their inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's try.\n\nFirst, create an instance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThan_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThan_x.right\n\nSimilarly, for y >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, actually, for y >= 0, it's y >= 0, so left: y, right: 0\n\nThen, connect y_5390f5 to lessThanOrEqual_y.left\n\nAnd constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_y.right\n\nThen, create a Logic.And instance to combine these two:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) and1 root.Std_k98ojb.Logic.And {\n\nin1: lessThan_x.result\n\nin2: lessThanOrEqual_y.result\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition:\n\nx >= 0 and y < 0\n\nSo, x >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThanOrEqual_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_x.right\n\nAnd y < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect y_5390f5 to less"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function should take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero.\n\nSo, for example, take the number 121:\n\n- Positions are counted from left to right, starting with position 1 as odd.\n\n- Digits: 1 (position 1, odd), 2 (position 2, even), 1 (position 3, odd).\n\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum of digits in even positions: 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example, number 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even), 9 (odd)\n\n- Sum odd: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum even: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n1. Take an input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n3. Iterate through each digit, keeping track of whether its position is odd or even.\n\n4. Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\n7. Output true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI need to implement this logic using Midio nodes. I'll likely need nodes for string manipulation, math operations, loops, and conditionals.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n- First, I need to convert the number to a string so I can iterate through each digit.\n\n- Then, I need to iterate through each character in the string, determining its position (odd or even).\n\n- For each digit, add it to the appropriate sum (odd or even).\n\n- After processing all digits, calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- Finally, check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers. The divisibility rule should work the same way regardless of the sign, so I can take the absolute value of the number before processing.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the input is zero. Zero is divisible by any non-zero number, including 11, so the function should return true for n=0.\n\nLet me outline the steps again, considering edge cases:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number to handle negatives.\n\n2. Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.\n\n3. Initialize two sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. Determine the position (odd or even based on index).\n\nb. Convert the character to a number.\n\nc. Add to the appropriate sum based on position.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the sums of odd and even positions.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11:\n\na. If the difference modulo 11 is 0, then it's divisible.\n\n7. Output true if divisible, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in programming, the modulo operator can be used to check divisibility. If a number modulo 11 equals zero, then it's divisible by 11.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the difference is divisible by 11, which includes negative differences, but since I'm taking the absolute value earlier, all differences should be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Midio:\n\n- I'll need a node to convert the number to a string.\n\n- A loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n\n- Conditionals to determine if the position is odd or even.\n\n- Math nodes to sum the digits accordingly.\n\n- A node to calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- A node to check if this difference is divisible by 11 using the modulo operation.\n\nI should also consider the efficiency, but since we're dealing with numbers that have a reasonable number of digits, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram of the nodes:\n\n- Start with the input number.\n\n- Connect to an \"absolute value\" math node.\n\n- Connect to a \"toString\" conversion node.\n\n- Connect to a \"split string\" node to get an array of characters.\n\n- Connect to a \"for each\" loop node.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get the index and character.\n\n- Determine if the index is odd or even.\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Add to odd sum or even sum based on position.\n\n- After the loop, subtract even sum from odd sum.\n\n- Take the absolute value of the difference.\n\n- Use modulo operator with 11.\n\n- Check if the result is 0.\n\n- Output true if yes, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the divisibility rule, we take the difference between sums of digits in odd and even positions, and check if that difference is divisible by 11. It's not necessary to take the absolute value of the difference because zero is considered divisible, and negative numbers are also considered divisible if their positive counterparts are.\n\nSo, in the modulo operation, both positive and negative differences that are multiples of 11 will yield zero.\n\nBut in programming, the modulo operator for negative numbers can behave differently depending on the language. In some languages, -11 modulo 11 is 0, but I need to confirm how Midio handles this.\n\nTo be safe, I can take the absolute value of the difference before applying the modulo operation.\n\nAlso, considering that the input can be a floating-point number, but for divisibility rules, we typically deal with integers. So, I should ensure that the input is an integer. If it's a float, I might need to truncate or round it to an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a number,\" not necessarily an integer. However, divisibility by 11 is generally defined for integers. So, I'll assume that the input is an integer.\n\nI should add a check to ensure that the input is an integer, and if not, perhaps round it to the nearest integer or return an error.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me also consider the case when the input is zero, as mentioned earlier. Zero should return true.\n\nAnother consideration is the sign of the number. Since divisibility is not affected by the sign, I can ignore the sign by taking the absolute value.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string.\n\n3. Split the string into an array of characters.\n\n4. Initialize two variables: sumOdd and sumEven to zero.\n\n5. Iterate through the array with indices:\n\na. For each character, convert it back to a number.\n\nb. If the index is odd, add to sumOdd; if even, add to sumEven.\n\n6. Calculate difference = sumOdd - sumEven.\n\n7. Compute abs(difference) % 11.\n\n8. If the result is zero, output true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in programming, array indices usually start at 0, which is even. But in our position count, we considered position 1 as odd.\n\nSo, to match positions:\n\n- Index 0 in the array corresponds to position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 corresponds to position 2 (even).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\n- For each character at index i:\n\n- If i is even (0, 2, 4,...), it's in an odd position.\n\n- If i is odd (1, 3, 5,...), it's in an even position.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nIn programming, array indices start at 0.\n\nBut positions in the number start at 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Character at index 0 is position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 is position 2 (even).\n\n- Index 2 is position 3 (odd).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, to determine if a position is odd or even:\n\n- If the index is even, position is odd.\n\n- If the index is odd, position is even.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, it's an odd position.\n\n- Else, even position.\n\nWait, but in programming terms:\n\n- Index 0 (even index) corresponds to odd position.\n\n- Index 1 (odd index) corresponds to even position.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the loop, I need to check if the index is even or odd to determine the position.\n\nNow, in Midio, how do I iterate through a string with indices?\n\nI think there's a way to get both the index and the value in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the string to an array of characters and iterate through it with indices.\n\nAssuming Midio has a \"for each with index\" loop, I can use that"

A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n2. Iterate through the digits, summing the digits in odd positions and the digits in even positions separately.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n4. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to implement this in Midio. Since Midio is a node-based programming language, I'll need to use various nodes to achieve this functionality.\n\nLet's start by outlining the main components:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n\n- Split the string into individual digits.\n\n- Determine the positions of the digits (odd or even).\n\n- Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n- Calculate the difference between these sums.\n\n- Check if the difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to look up the available nodes in Midio that can help with these tasks. From the list provided, I see nodes for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and control flow.\n\nFirst, to convert the number to a string, I can use the \"Strings.ToString\" node, but it's not listed in the provided external functions. Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for getting the last digit, and \"Math.Div\" for removing the last digit.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- Use \"Math.Mod\" with 10 to get the last digit.\n\n- Add or subtract the digit from an accumulating sum, alternating signs.\n\n- Use \"Math.Div\" by 10 to remove the last digit.\n\n- Continue until the number is zero.\n\n- Finally, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if it's zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a predefined number of iterations, which in this case is not known in advance because it depends on the number of digits in the input number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach or a while-loop-like structure.\n\nLooking at the nodes provided, \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit here. Maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nAnother idea: since the number of digits is finite, I can assume a maximum number of digits and loop that many times, but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to implement a while-loop in Midio. Perhaps \"Std.For\" can be adapted for this purpose.\n\nUpon closer inspection, \"Std.For\" has inputs for \"items\", \"execute\", \"reset\", etc., but it's designed for iterating over a list of items, not for condition-based looping.\n\nMaybe I need to use a combination of nodes to create a loop that continues until the number is zero.\n\nPerhaps I can use a \"Std.While\" node if it exists, but it's not in the provided list. Maybe I need to simulate a while-loop using other nodes.\n\nLet me think about using recursion. I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nBut Midio seems to be a node-based visual programming language, and recursion might not be straightforward or efficient.\n\nAnother approach: convert the number to a string, split it into digits, and then process each digit with a loop.\n\nSince string manipulation nodes are available, this might be feasible.\n\nLooking back, perhaps converting to a string is a reasonable approach in Midio.\n\nSo, here's an updated plan:\n\n1. Convert the input number to a string.\n\n2. Split the string into individual characters (digits).\n\n3. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each digit.\n\n4. Convert each character back to a number.\n\n5. Alternate adding and subtracting these numbers to compute the alternating sum.\n\n6. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, let's look at the specific nodes I might need:\n\n- \"Strings.ToString\" to convert the number to a string.\n\n- \"Strings.Split\" to split the string into characters.\n\n- \"Std.For\" to iterate over the list of characters.\n\n- \"Strings.ToNumber\" to convert each character back to a number.\n\n- \"Math.Add\" and \"Math.Subtract\" to compute the alternating sum.\n\n- \"Math.Mod\" to check if the sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Strings.ToString\" and \"Strings.Split\" are not in the provided list of external functions. I need to confirm which nodes are available.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- Std: likely includes standard utilities like loops, conditions, etc.\n\n- Http: for HTTP requests, probably not needed here.\n\nI need to see if there are string manipulation nodes available under \"Std\" or another module.\n\nPerhaps I need to import a string utility module if it exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get the digits without converting to a string, using mathematical operations.\n\nLet me consider the mathematical approach again:\n\n- Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sign (start with addition).\n\n- While the number is greater than zero:\n\n- Get the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Multiply it by the current sign (+1 or -1).\n\n- Add it to the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number using \"Math.Div\" with 10.\n\n- Flip the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11.\n\nThis seems doable with mathematical nodes.\n\nI need to implement a loop that continues until the number is zero. Since \"Std.For\" is designed for iterating over items, not for condition-based loops, I might need to simulate a while-loop.\n\nOne way to simulate a while-loop is to use recursion or to use a loop node that can be conditioned to continue based on a certain predicate.\n\nUpon further thought, perhaps I can use \"Std.While\" if it's available, even if it's not listed in the provided external functions. I should check the documentation or the list again to confirm.\n\nWait, the provided external functions include \"Std.For\", which might be adaptable for this purpose.\n\nLet me consider using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range to cover the maximum number of digits possible in the input number.\n\nFor example, if the input number is less than 10^18 (a common limit), then it has at most 18 digits. So, I can set \"Std.For\" to iterate 18 times, and inside the loop, process each digit if it exists.\n\nBut this seems a bit hacky. A better way would be to conditionally exit the loop when the number is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a state machine approach, where the loop continues as long as the number is not zero.\n\nGiven that \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit for this, maybe I need to think of another way.\n\nLet me consider using recursion by creating a sub-module that calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nIn Midio, it's possible to create recursive modules, but it might be complicated for this task.\n\nAnother idea: use a \"Std.While\" node if it's available. Although it's not in the provided list, perhaps it's implicitly available or can be simulated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use triggers and connections to create a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for the current context. Perhaps I should stick with the mathematical approach using \"Std.For\" with a fixed number of iterations, assuming the input number has fewer than, say, 20 digits.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Set up \"Std.For\" to iterate 20 times.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Check if the number is zero. If so, exit the loop.\n\n- Otherwise, process the last digit.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n\n-"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array. The function should take a list of numbers as input and return their sum. I need to make sure that it handles different types of lists, including empty lists, and that it correctly sums up the elements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle lists in Midio. From the external functions provided, I see there are several list manipulation functions like List.Length, List.Contains, List.Sort, etc. But for summing up the elements, I might need to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum.\n\nLooking at the Iteration.Map and Iteration.Reduce functions, it seems that Iteration.Reduce could be particularly useful here because it allows me to accumulate a value by applying a function to each element of the list.\n\nSo, my plan is to use Iteration.Reduce to iterate through the list, adding each element to an accumulator starting from 0. This should give me the sum of all elements in the list.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up in Midio. I'll need to create a reduce function that takes the list as input and specifies a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulated sum.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the sum should be 0. I'm not sure how Iteration.Reduce handles empty lists, so I might need to check if the list is empty beforehand and handle that separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Iteration.Reduce can handle empty lists by just returning the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nLet me look up the documentation for Iteration.Reduce:\n\n\"Reduces the list `item` using the provided reducer function, which is expected to accept 2-4 inputs, the first being the accumulated value, and the second the value being accumulated. A third optional input will contain the current index, while the fourth optional input will contain the context input.\"\n\nOkay, so it seems like I can provide a reducer function that takes at least two inputs: the accumulator and the current element.\n\nI need to make sure that when the list is empty, the reduce function returns the initial value, which should be 0 in this case.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set the initial value of the accumulator to 0, and then for each element in the list, add it to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create an instance of Iteration.Reduce, provide the list and the reducer function, and specify the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nI'll also need to define the reducer function. Since Midio is a node-based language, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n2. Connect the input list to the 'items' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n3. Define a reducer function that takes two inputs: accumulator and current element, and outputs their sum.\n\n4. Connect this reducer function to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n5. Set the initial value of the accumulator to 0.\n\n6. The result of Iteration.Reduce will be the sum of the list, which I can output.\n\nAlso, I should consider what happens if the list contains non-numeric elements. Since this is a sum function for numbers, I need to ensure that only numeric elements are summed. Maybe I should add a check in the reducer function to ignore non-numeric elements.\n\nBut for simplicity, and assuming that the list contains only numbers, I'll proceed without adding extra checks.\n\nLet me consider writing some pseudocode first:\n\nfunction sum(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 0\n\nelse:\n\ninitialize accumulator to 0\n\nfor each element in list:\n\naccumulator += element\n\nreturn accumulator\n\nIn Midio, this would translate to using Iteration.Reduce with an initial value of 0 and a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based syntax.\n\nI need to create a function called \"_sum\" with an input property \"list\" of type List and an output property \"sum\" of type Number.\n\nInside this function, I'll instantiate Iteration.Reduce, define the reducer function, set the initial accumulator value, and connect everything appropriately.\n\nI also need to make sure that the function handles empty lists correctly, returning 0 in that case.\n\nLet me consider how to define the reducer function. Since Midio is node-based, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows inline expressions or lambda functions, I could define the reducer directly.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, I see Math.Add, which takes two numbers and returns their sum. Maybe I can use Math.Add directly as the reducer function, with the accumulator and current element as inputs.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes the accumulator and current element and returns the new accumulator value, which is exactly what Math.Add does if the accumulator and current element are numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use Math.Add as the reducer function directly.\n\nLet me think about this: if I connect Math.Add to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce, with the accumulator connected to 'first' and the current element connected to 'second', then Iteration.Reduce should correctly sum up the list.\n\nI need to confirm whether Iteration.Reduce can directly use Math.Add in this manner.\n\nAssuming that's possible, my setup would be:\n\n- Instance of Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Connect 'items' to the input list\n\n- Set 'initial_value' to 0\n\n- Connect 'reducer' to Math.Add\n\n- The result of Iteration.Reduce would be the sum, which I can output.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to ensure that if the list is empty, Iteration.Reduce returns the initial value, which is 0, as expected.\n\nI should also consider performance, but for now, since this is likely an internal operation, I won't worry about optimizing it further.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio's syntax.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module and the sum function:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {\n\nin(x: -213, y: 28, name: \"list\") property(List) list_2c62ab\n\nout(x: 567, y: 3, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_2a848f\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 100, y: 100) reduce_e4a7b3 root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\nitems: list_2c62ab\n\ninitial_value: 0\n\nreducer: add_c5f3d1\n\n}\n\ninstance(x: 200, y: 100) add_c5f3d1 root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\n\n\nreduce_e4a7b3.result -> sum_2a848f\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the reducer function takes two inputs: accumulator and current element.\n\nIn Midio, functions might require specific input connections.\n\nLooking at Math.Add, it takes 'first' and 'second' inputs and produces a 'result'.\n\nSo, in the context of Iteration.Reduce, I need to map the accumulator to 'first' and the current element to 'second'.\n\nI'm not sure if simply assigning 'reducer: add_c5f3d1' is sufficient. Maybe I need to specify how the inputs are connected.\n\nPerhaps I need to use a higher-order function or specify the connections more explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Iteration.Reduce automatically wires the accumulator and current element to the reducer's inputs.\n\nI need to check the documentation for Iteration.Reduce to understand how to connect the reducer function.\n\nAssuming that Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes two inputs (accumulator and current element), and outputs the new accumulator value, then connecting Math.Add directly should work, as it adds two numbers and produces a sum.\n\nSo, in this case, the accumulator would be the first input to Math.Add, and the current element would be the second input.\n\nThe output of Math.Add would be the new accumulator value.\n\nThis seems correct for summing up a list.\n\nNow, to handle empty lists, I set the initial_value to 0, so if the list is empty, the result should be 0.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nLet me consider testing this function with some example lists:\n\n- [1, 2, 3] should return 6\n\n- [10, 20, 30] should return 60\n\n- [] should return 0\n\n- [5] should return 5\n\nI can mentally verify that the reduce operation with Math.Add and initial value 0 would produce these results.\n\nI don't think I need to handle cases where the list contains non-numeric elements, as per the task description, but if needed, I could add additional checks.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with this implementation.\n\nLet me write the Midio code accordingly.\n\n\nTo create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array, you can use the `Iteration.Reduce` function along with `Math.Add`. Here's how you can structure your code:\n\n```midio\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nmodule() main {\n\n    func(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {"

                "I'm going to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function will take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n2. Iterate through the digits, summing the digits in odd positions and the digits in even positions separately.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n4. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to implement this in Midio. Since Midio is a node-based programming language, I'll need to use various nodes to achieve this functionality.\n\nLet's start by outlining the main components:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n\n- Split the string into individual digits.\n\n- Determine the positions of the digits (odd or even).\n\n- Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n- Calculate the difference between these sums.\n\n- Check if the difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to look up the available nodes in Midio that can help with these tasks. From the list provided, I see nodes for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and control flow.\n\nFirst, to convert the number to a string, I can use the \"Strings.ToString\" node, but it's not listed in the provided external functions. Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for modulo operation, \"Math.Div\" for division, and \"Math.Sub\" for subtraction.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- In each iteration, calculate the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Add or subtract this digit from the alternating sum based on the current sign.\n\n- Remove the last digit by integer division of the number by 10.\n\n- Alternate the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a list or a range to iterate over, which might not be directly applicable here since I need to iterate based on the number of digits in the number.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of digits first and then use \"Std.For\" to loop that many times.\n\nTo find the number of digits, I can convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, string conversion is not straightforward.\n\nAnother mathematical way to find the number of digits is to use logarithms, but I'm not sure if Midio has logarithm functions.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a while loop, where I keep processing the number until it becomes zero, similar to the steps I outlined earlier.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, there is no direct \"while\" loop, but I can simulate it using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range and early exit conditions.\n\nHowever, this might be inefficient. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use recursion to process each digit one by one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursive function calls.\n\nLet me consider another approach: since the number can be large, but for practical purposes, let's assume it's within the integer range that Midio handles.\n\nI'll proceed with the loop approach using \"Std.For\" and handle the digits one by one.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Determine the number of digits in the input number.\n\n- As mentioned earlier, this can be done by converting to a string and getting its length, but since string conversion is not straightforward, I'll look for an alternative.\n\n- Alternatively, I can use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it becomes zero, counting the number of iterations. This will give me the number of digits.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate from 0 to the number of digits minus one.\n\n3. In each iteration:\n\na. Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\nb. Depending on the position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n4. After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's consider how to implement step 1: finding the number of digits.\n\nI'll need to create a counter that increments each time the number is divided by 10 until it becomes zero.\n\nThis can be done using another \"Std.For\" loop with a large range and an early exit condition, but this might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a function that calculates the number of digits mathematically without looping, but without logarithms, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a lookup table for the number of digits based on the range of the number, but that seems overly complicated.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the number of digits is less than, say, 20, and use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range up to 20, and handle cases where the number has fewer digits.\n\nSo, in the main function, I'll have:\n\n- An input property for the number.\n\n- An output property for the boolean result.\n\n- Instances of various nodes to perform the required operations.\n\nLet me start by defining the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"finds whether a number is divisible by 11.\") is_diff {\n\nin(x: 5, y: -25, name: \"n\") property(Number) n_27f29c\n\nout(x: 668, y: 2, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_f2630f\n\n}\n\nNow, within this function, I need to implement the logic.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of digits in 'n'. Since direct string conversion isn't straightforward, I'll use a loop to count the digits.\n\nI can use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range, say 20 iterations, and in each iteration, check if the number is still greater than zero. If it is, increment the digit count and divide the number by 10.\n\nBut since \"Std.For\" iterates over a list or range, and I need to exit early when the number becomes zero, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can always iterate 20 times and ignore iterations beyond the actual number of digits.\n\nProceeding with this approach:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\n- Add or subtract it from the alternating sum based on the position.\n\n- Accumulate the alternating sum.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Iteration.Map\" is typically for transforming lists, not for accumulating a value.\n\nMaybe I need to use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to accumulate the alternating sum.\n\nLooking back at the provided nodes, I see \"Iteration.Aggregate\", which might be suitable for accumulating a value.\n\nBut to use \"Iteration.Aggregate\", I need to provide an initial value and a function that combines the accumulator with each element of the list.\n\nIn this case, the list would be the digits of the number, but since I don't have a straightforward way to get the digits as a list, I need to generate them within the aggregate function.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use a recursive function where I process one digit at a time and pass the accumulated sum and the remaining number to the next recursion.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursion.\n\nGiven these constraints, maybe it's simpler to proceed with the initial plan of using \"Std.For\" with a fixed range and ignoring extra iterations.\n\nHere's how it could work:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the last digit of 'n' using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Depending on the current position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to return a list that contains elements which are unique to each list, meaning elements that are not shared between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are in A but not in B, combined with those that are in B but not in A. Essentially, it's the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A - B) \u222a (B - A).\n\nMidio seems to have some set operations available, like Sets.Difference. Maybe I can use that to find the differences and then combine them.\n\nLet me look at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Sets.Difference: Returns the difference of two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\n\n- List.Concat: Concatenates two lists.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the difference of list1 minus list2, and then the difference of list2 minus list1, and then concatenate those two differences to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to handle that appropriately. Maybe I should treat the lists as sets, so duplicates are ignored.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists,\" and it doesn't specify whether duplicates should be considered or not. Perhaps I should assume that duplicates are possible in the lists, and the output should include duplicates appropriately.\n\nFor example, if list1 is [1, 2, 2, 3] and list2 is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4]. Notice that 2 appears twice in list1, but in the symmetric difference, it appears once because it's present in both lists.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if my understanding of handling duplicates is correct. In set theory, sets don't have duplicates, so symmetric difference doesn't consider multiples. But since we're dealing with lists, which can have duplicates, perhaps the output should reflect the counts appropriately.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of list operations rather than set operations.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nlist1: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nlist2: [2, 3, 4]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be elements that are unique to each list.\n\nSo, elements in list1 not in list2: [1, 2]\n\nElements in list2 not in list1: [4]\n\nThen, combining these: [1, 2, 4]\n\nBut in list1, 2 appears twice, but in list2, 2 appears only once. So, the dissimilar elements should have one 2, because one 2 is shared.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother way is to compute the union of the two lists and then remove the intersection. That would give me the elements that are not common to both lists.\n\nSo, union(A, B) - intersection(A, B)\n\nThat's another way to compute the symmetric difference.\n\nBut in Midio, I need to find instances or functions that can compute union and intersection.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions:\n\n- Sets.Intersection: Returns the intersection of two input lists.\n\n- List.Union: Not listed, so maybe not available?\n\nIf List.Union is not available, I might need to implement union using other operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Sets.Difference function twice and then concatenate the results.\n\nSo, (list1 - intersection(list1, list2)) concatenated with (list2 - intersection(list1, list2))\n\nThat should give me the symmetric difference.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI need to create a function called find_dissimilar with two inputs: list1 and list2 of type List, and an output output of type List.\n\nInside the function, I'll need to:\n\n1. Compute the intersection of list1 and list2.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list1 minus the intersection.\n\n3. Compute the difference of list2 minus the intersection.\n\n4. Concatenate the results of step 2 and step 3 to get the final output.\n\nSo, I'll need three instances: two Sets.Difference and one List.Concat.\n\nAlso, one Sets.Intersection to find the common elements.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Instance intersection (Sets.Intersection) with left connected to list1 and right connected to list2.\n\n- Instance difference1 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list1 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance difference2 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list2 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance concat (List.Concat) with left connected to difference1.difference and right connected to difference2.difference.\n\n- Connect concat.list to output.\n\nThis should give me the symmetric difference of list1 and list2.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more efficient way or if there are built-in functions that can do this in fewer steps.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, there's no direct symmetric difference function, so this seems like the way to go.\n\nI should also think about the types of the lists. Are they lists of integers, strings, or any type? Midio seems to have a generic List type, so perhaps it can handle any type.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the lists contain comparable elements, whatever that means in Midio.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the Sets.Difference function handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nIf list1 has duplicates, and list2 has some of those duplicates, how does Sets.Difference handle them?\n\nI need to check the documentation for Sets.Difference to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nLooking back, the documentation says: \"Returns the difference of the two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how duplicates are handled. Maybe it removes duplicates or preserves them.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that Sets.Difference preserves duplicates from the left list unless they are present in the right list.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should just proceed with the assumption that Sets.Difference works appropriately for lists with duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, if Sets.Difference doesn't handle duplicates as desired, maybe I need to preprocess the lists to remove duplicates before computing the intersection and differences.\n\nBut that would add more complexity, and the problem didn't specify how to handle duplicates, so perhaps it's acceptable to handle them in whatever way Sets.Difference handles them.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the initial plan.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any edge cases:\n\n- If either list is empty, the dissimilar elements should be the non-empty list.\n\n- If both lists are empty, the dissimilar elements should be an empty list.\n\n- If both lists are identical, the dissimilar elements should be an empty list.\n\n- If there are duplicates, handle them according to Sets.Difference behavior.\n\nI need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function is efficient enough for large lists, but since Midio is a graphical programming language, efficiency might not be my primary concern here.\n\nAssuming that the Sets.Difference and List.Concat functions are optimized, my implementation should be fine.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into Midio code.\n\nGiven that, here's how the function would look:\n\nfunc(doc: \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\") find_dissimilar {\n\nin(x: -531, y: 2, name: \"list1\") property(List) list1_ai\n\nin(x: -165, y: 68, name: \"list2\") property(List) list2_ai\n\nout(x: 340, y: 77, name: \"output\") property(List) output_ai\n\n\n\ninstance(x: -121, y: -71) intersection_78d487 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Intersection {}\n\nlist1_ai -> intersection_78d487.left\n\nlist2_ai -> intersection_78d487.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 169, y: -77) difference1_cd5cc4 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Difference {}\n\nlist1_ai -> difference1_cd5cc4.left\n\nintersection_78d487.intersection -> difference1_cd5cc4.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 169, y: 100) difference2_cd5cc4 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Difference {}\n\nlist2_ai -> difference2_cd5cc4.left\n\nintersection_78d487.intersection -> difference2_cd5cc4.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 300, y: 15) concat_abc123 root.Std_k98ojb.List.Concat {}\n\ndifference1_cd5cc4.difference -> concat_abc123.left\n\ndifference2_cd5cc4.difference -> concat_abc123.right\n\n\n\nconcat_abc123.list -> output_ai\n\n}\n\nThis should accomplish the task of finding dissimilar elements between two lists by computing their symmetric difference"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. So, if one is positive and the other is negative, it should return true; otherwise, false. I need to make sure that this works correctly for any integer values, including zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to have opposite signs. If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. However, if both are positive or both are negative, they do not have opposite signs. Also, if either or both of the numbers are zero, since zero is neither positive nor negative, I need to decide how to handle that case.\n\nIn most programming contexts, zero is considered non-negative. So, if one number is zero and the other is positive, they don't have opposite signs. Similarly, if one is zero and the other is negative, they don't have opposite signs. If both are zero, they obviously don't have opposite signs.\n\nSo, my function needs to return true only when one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nNow, how can I implement this in Midio? I need to use the available external functions to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions, I see that there are mathematical and logical operations available. Specifically, there's a \"Math.Expression\" function that can evaluate expressions like \"a < 0 && b >= 0\" or similar conditions.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to multiply the two numbers. If the product is negative, then they have opposite signs. If the product is positive, they have the same sign. If the product is zero, then at least one of them is zero.\n\nWait, but multiplication can overflow if the numbers are very large in magnitude. Although in Midio, I assume that number types can handle large values, but still, it's something to consider.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the sign of each number individually and then see if they are different.\n\nIn programming terms, for integers, the sign can be checked using comparison operators. For example, if x < 0, it's negative; if x >= 0, it's non-negative.\n\nSo, I can check if (x < 0 && y >= 0) || (x >= 0 && y < 0). If this condition is true, then the numbers have opposite signs.\n\nIn Midio, I can use logical operators to construct this condition.\n\nLooking at the external functions, there's \"Logic.And\" and \"Logic.Or\" that can be used to combine conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up two \"Logic.And\" instances:\n\n1. One with (x < 0) and (y >= 0)\n\n2. Another with (x >= 0) and (y < 0)\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Or\" to combine the results of these two \"And\" operations.\n\nBut to check if x < 0, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" function, and similarly for y >= 0 using \"Math.GreaterThanOrEqual\".\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Maybe it's \"Math.LessThan\"?\n\nActually, in the list provided, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Hmm.\n\nWait, here's \"Math.LessThan\": \"Checks if 'left' is less than 'right'\"\n\nYes, there is \"Math.LessThan\".\n\nSo, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" for x < 0 and \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\" for y >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition.\n\nSo, let's sketch this out.\n\nI need:\n\n- Check if x < 0 (using Math.LessThan with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y >= 0 (using Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Check if x >= 0 (Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y < 0 (Math.LessThan with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nThen, combine the two \"And\" results with \"Logic.Or\" to get the final output.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the case when either x or y is zero.\n\nIf x is zero and y is positive, then (x >= 0 && y < 0) is false, and (x < 0 && y >= 0) is false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if both are zero, both conditions are false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nIf x is positive and y is negative, one condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nIf x is negative and y is positive, the other condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nSeems good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplication approach:\n\nMultiply x and y, and check if the result is negative.\n\nBut this might have issues with overflow for large integers, although in Midio, numbers might be handled differently.\n\nAlso, multiplying two large numbers could be less efficient than simple comparisons.\n\nSo, stick with the comparison-based approach.\n\nNow, to implement this in Midio, I need to set up the instances accordingly.\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\nI need to create instances for:\n\n- Math.LessThan for x < 0\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for y >= 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nSimilarly for the other condition:\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for x >= 0\n\n- Math.LessThan for y < 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nThen, Logic.Or to combine the two And results.\n\nFinally, connect the output to the output property.\n\nI need to make sure that the connections are correct, i.e., the outputs of the conditions are connected to the Logic.And inputs, and the outputs of the Logic.And instances are connected to the Logic.Or inputs, and finally, the Logic.Or output is connected to the final output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the input properties x and y are connected to the respective Math functions.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out in code format.\n\nFirst, import the standard library:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the function, create the instances.\n\nInstance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: some_x, y: some_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, in Midio, instance connections are made via arrows, and properties are connected.\n\nSo, actually, I need to define instances and connect their inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's try.\n\nFirst, create an instance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThan_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThan_x.right\n\nSimilarly, for y >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, actually, for y >= 0, it's y >= 0, so left: y, right: 0\n\nThen, connect y_5390f5 to lessThanOrEqual_y.left\n\nAnd constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_y.right\n\nThen, create a Logic.And instance to combine these two:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) and1 root.Std_k98ojb.Logic.And {\n\nin1: lessThan_x.result\n\nin2: lessThanOrEqual_y.result\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition:\n\nx >= 0 and y < 0\n\nSo, x >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThanOrEqual_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_x.right\n\nAnd y < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect y_5390f5 to less"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function should take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero.\n\nSo, for example, take the number 121:\n\n- Positions are counted from left to right, starting with position 1 as odd.\n\n- Digits: 1 (position 1, odd), 2 (position 2, even), 1 (position 3, odd).\n\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum of digits in even positions: 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example, number 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even), 9 (odd)\n\n- Sum odd: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum even: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n1. Take an input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n3. Iterate through each digit, keeping track of whether its position is odd or even.\n\n4. Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\n7. Output true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI need to implement this logic using Midio nodes. I'll likely need nodes for string manipulation, math operations, loops, and conditionals.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n- First, I need to convert the number to a string so I can iterate through each digit.\n\n- Then, I need to iterate through each character in the string, determining its position (odd or even).\n\n- For each digit, add it to the appropriate sum (odd or even).\n\n- After processing all digits, calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- Finally, check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers. The divisibility rule should work the same way regardless of the sign, so I can take the absolute value of the number before processing.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the input is zero. Zero is divisible by any non-zero number, including 11, so the function should return true for n=0.\n\nLet me outline the steps again, considering edge cases:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number to handle negatives.\n\n2. Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.\n\n3. Initialize two sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. Determine the position (odd or even based on index).\n\nb. Convert the character to a number.\n\nc. Add to the appropriate sum based on position.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the sums of odd and even positions.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11:\n\na. If the difference modulo 11 is 0, then it's divisible.\n\n7. Output true if divisible, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in programming, the modulo operator can be used to check divisibility. If a number modulo 11 equals zero, then it's divisible by 11.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the difference is divisible by 11, which includes negative differences, but since I'm taking the absolute value earlier, all differences should be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Midio:\n\n- I'll need a node to convert the number to a string.\n\n- A loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n\n- Conditionals to determine if the position is odd or even.\n\n- Math nodes to sum the digits accordingly.\n\n- A node to calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- A node to check if this difference is divisible by 11 using the modulo operation.\n\nI should also consider the efficiency, but since we're dealing with numbers that have a reasonable number of digits, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram of the nodes:\n\n- Start with the input number.\n\n- Connect to an \"absolute value\" math node.\n\n- Connect to a \"toString\" conversion node.\n\n- Connect to a \"split string\" node to get an array of characters.\n\n- Connect to a \"for each\" loop node.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get the index and character.\n\n- Determine if the index is odd or even.\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Add to odd sum or even sum based on position.\n\n- After the loop, subtract even sum from odd sum.\n\n- Take the absolute value of the difference.\n\n- Use modulo operator with 11.\n\n- Check if the result is 0.\n\n- Output true if yes, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the divisibility rule, we take the difference between sums of digits in odd and even positions, and check if that difference is divisible by 11. It's not necessary to take the absolute value of the difference because zero is considered divisible, and negative numbers are also considered divisible if their positive counterparts are.\n\nSo, in the modulo operation, both positive and negative differences that are multiples of 11 will yield zero.\n\nBut in programming, the modulo operator for negative numbers can behave differently depending on the language. In some languages, -11 modulo 11 is 0, but I need to confirm how Midio handles this.\n\nTo be safe, I can take the absolute value of the difference before applying the modulo operation.\n\nAlso, considering that the input can be a floating-point number, but for divisibility rules, we typically deal with integers. So, I should ensure that the input is an integer. If it's a float, I might need to truncate or round it to an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a number,\" not necessarily an integer. However, divisibility by 11 is generally defined for integers. So, I'll assume that the input is an integer.\n\nI should add a check to ensure that the input is an integer, and if not, perhaps round it to the nearest integer or return an error.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me also consider the case when the input is zero, as mentioned earlier. Zero should return true.\n\nAnother consideration is the sign of the number. Since divisibility is not affected by the sign, I can ignore the sign by taking the absolute value.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string.\n\n3. Split the string into an array of characters.\n\n4. Initialize two variables: sumOdd and sumEven to zero.\n\n5. Iterate through the array with indices:\n\na. For each character, convert it back to a number.\n\nb. If the index is odd, add to sumOdd; if even, add to sumEven.\n\n6. Calculate difference = sumOdd - sumEven.\n\n7. Compute abs(difference) % 11.\n\n8. If the result is zero, output true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in programming, array indices usually start at 0, which is even. But in our position count, we considered position 1 as odd.\n\nSo, to match positions:\n\n- Index 0 in the array corresponds to position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 corresponds to position 2 (even).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\n- For each character at index i:\n\n- If i is even (0, 2, 4,...), it's in an odd position.\n\n- If i is odd (1, 3, 5,...), it's in an even position.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nIn programming, array indices start at 0.\n\nBut positions in the number start at 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Character at index 0 is position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 is position 2 (even).\n\n- Index 2 is position 3 (odd).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, to determine if a position is odd or even:\n\n- If the index is even, position is odd.\n\n- If the index is odd, position is even.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, it's an odd position.\n\n- Else, even position.\n\nWait, but in programming terms:\n\n- Index 0 (even index) corresponds to odd position.\n\n- Index 1 (odd index) corresponds to even position.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the loop, I need to check if the index is even or odd to determine the position.\n\nNow, in Midio, how do I iterate through a string with indices?\n\nI think there's a way to get both the index and the value in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the string to an array of characters and iterate through it with indices.\n\nAssuming Midio has a \"for each with index\" loop, I can use that"

A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1.

Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n4. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to implement this in Midio. Since Midio is a node-based programming language, I'll need to use various nodes to achieve this functionality.\n\nLet's start by outlining the main components:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n\n- Split the string into individual digits.\n\n- Determine the positions of the digits (odd or even).\n\n- Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n- Calculate the difference between these sums.\n\n- Check if the difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to look up the available nodes in Midio that can help with these tasks. From the list provided, I see nodes for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and control flow.\n\nFirst, to convert the number to a string, I can use the \"Strings.ToString\" node, but it's not listed in the provided external functions. Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for getting the last digit, and \"Math.Div\" for removing the last digit.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- Use \"Math.Mod\" with 10 to get the last digit.\n\n- Add or subtract the digit from an accumulating sum, alternating signs.\n\n- Use \"Math.Div\" by 10 to remove the last digit.\n\n- Continue until the number is zero.\n\n- Finally, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if it's zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a predefined number of iterations, which in this case is not known in advance because it depends on the number of digits in the input number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a recursive approach or a while-loop-like structure.\n\nLooking at the nodes provided, \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit here. Maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nAnother idea: since the number of digits is finite, I can assume a maximum number of digits and loop that many times, but that seems inefficient.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to implement a while-loop in Midio. Perhaps \"Std.For\" can be adapted for this purpose.\n\nUpon closer inspection, \"Std.For\" has inputs for \"items\", \"execute\", \"reset\", etc., but it's designed for iterating over a list of items, not for condition-based looping.\n\nMaybe I need to use a combination of nodes to create a loop that continues until the number is zero.\n\nPerhaps I can use a \"Std.While\" node if it exists, but it's not in the provided list. Maybe I need to simulate a while-loop using other nodes.\n\nLet me think about using recursion. I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nBut Midio seems to be a node-based visual programming language, and recursion might not be straightforward or efficient.\n\nAnother approach: convert the number to a string, split it into digits, and then process each digit with a loop.\n\nSince string manipulation nodes are available, this might be feasible.\n\nLooking back, perhaps converting to a string is a reasonable approach in Midio.\n\nSo, here's an updated plan:\n\n1. Convert the input number to a string.\n\n2. Split the string into individual characters (digits).\n\n3. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each digit.\n\n4. Convert each character back to a number.\n\n5. Alternate adding and subtracting these numbers to compute the alternating sum.\n\n6. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, let's look at the specific nodes I might need:\n\n- \"Strings.ToString\" to convert the number to a string.\n\n- \"Strings.Split\" to split the string into characters.\n\n- \"Std.For\" to iterate over the list of characters.\n\n- \"Strings.ToNumber\" to convert each character back to a number.\n\n- \"Math.Add\" and \"Math.Subtract\" to compute the alternating sum.\n\n- \"Math.Mod\" to check if the sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Strings.ToString\" and \"Strings.Split\" are not in the provided list of external functions. I need to confirm which nodes are available.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- Std: likely includes standard utilities like loops, conditions, etc.\n\n- Http: for HTTP requests, probably not needed here.\n\nI need to see if there are string manipulation nodes available under \"Std\" or another module.\n\nPerhaps I need to import a string utility module if it exists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to get the digits without converting to a string, using mathematical operations.\n\nLet me consider the mathematical approach again:\n\n- Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sign (start with addition).\n\n- While the number is greater than zero:\n\n- Get the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Multiply it by the current sign (+1 or -1).\n\n- Add it to the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number using \"Math.Div\" with 10.\n\n- Flip the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11.\n\nThis seems doable with mathematical nodes.\n\nI need to implement a loop that continues until the number is zero. Since \"Std.For\" is designed for iterating over items, not for condition-based loops, I might need to simulate a while-loop.\n\nOne way to simulate a while-loop is to use recursion or to use a loop node that can be conditioned to continue based on a certain predicate.\n\nUpon further thought, perhaps I can use \"Std.While\" if it's available, even if it's not listed in the provided external functions. I should check the documentation or the list again to confirm.\n\nWait, the provided external functions include \"Std.For\", which might be adaptable for this purpose.\n\nLet me consider using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range to cover the maximum number of digits possible in the input number.\n\nFor example, if the input number is less than 10^18 (a common limit), then it has at most 18 digits. So, I can set \"Std.For\" to iterate 18 times, and inside the loop, process each digit if it exists.\n\nBut this seems a bit hacky. A better way would be to conditionally exit the loop when the number is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a state machine approach, where the loop continues as long as the number is not zero.\n\nGiven that \"Std.For\" might not be the best fit for this, maybe I need to think of another way.\n\nLet me consider using recursion by creating a sub-module that calls itself until the number is zero.\n\nIn Midio, it's possible to create recursive modules, but it might be complicated for this task.\n\nAnother idea: use a \"Std.While\" node if it's available. Although it's not in the provided list, perhaps it's implicitly available or can be simulated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use triggers and connections to create a loop that repeats until a certain condition is met.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for the current context. Perhaps I should stick with the mathematical approach using \"Std.For\" with a fixed number of iterations, assuming the input number has fewer than, say, 20 digits.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- Set up \"Std.For\" to iterate 20 times.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Check if the number is zero. If so, exit the loop.\n\n- Otherwise, process the last digit.\n\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n\n-"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array. The function should take a list of numbers as input and return their sum. I need to make sure that it handles different types of lists, including empty lists, and that it correctly sums up the elements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle lists in Midio. From the external functions provided, I see there are several list manipulation functions like List.Length, List.Contains, List.Sort, etc. But for summing up the elements, I might need to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum.\n\nLooking at the Iteration.Map and Iteration.Reduce functions, it seems that Iteration.Reduce could be particularly useful here because it allows me to accumulate a value by applying a function to each element of the list.\n\nSo, my plan is to use Iteration.Reduce to iterate through the list, adding each element to an accumulator starting from 0. This should give me the sum of all elements in the list.\n\nLet me think about how to set this up in Midio. I'll need to create a reduce function that takes the list as input and specifies a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulated sum.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the sum should be 0. I'm not sure how Iteration.Reduce handles empty lists, so I might need to check if the list is empty beforehand and handle that separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Iteration.Reduce can handle empty lists by just returning the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nLet me look up the documentation for Iteration.Reduce:\n\n\"Reduces the list `item` using the provided reducer function, which is expected to accept 2-4 inputs, the first being the accumulated value, and the second the value being accumulated. A third optional input will contain the current index, while the fourth optional input will contain the context input.\"\n\nOkay, so it seems like I can provide a reducer function that takes at least two inputs: the accumulator and the current element.\n\nI need to make sure that when the list is empty, the reduce function returns the initial value, which should be 0 in this case.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set the initial value of the accumulator to 0, and then for each element in the list, add it to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create an instance of Iteration.Reduce, provide the list and the reducer function, and specify the initial value of the accumulator.\n\nI'll also need to define the reducer function. Since Midio is a node-based language, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n1. Create an instance of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n2. Connect the input list to the 'items' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n3. Define a reducer function that takes two inputs: accumulator and current element, and outputs their sum.\n\n4. Connect this reducer function to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce.\n\n5. Set the initial value of the accumulator to 0.\n\n6. The result of Iteration.Reduce will be the sum of the list, which I can output.\n\nAlso, I should consider what happens if the list contains non-numeric elements. Since this is a sum function for numbers, I need to ensure that only numeric elements are summed. Maybe I should add a check in the reducer function to ignore non-numeric elements.\n\nBut for simplicity, and assuming that the list contains only numbers, I'll proceed without adding extra checks.\n\nLet me consider writing some pseudocode first:\n\nfunction sum(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 0\n\nelse:\n\ninitialize accumulator to 0\n\nfor each element in list:\n\naccumulator += element\n\nreturn accumulator\n\nIn Midio, this would translate to using Iteration.Reduce with an initial value of 0 and a reducer function that adds the current element to the accumulator.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based syntax.\n\nI need to create a function called \"_sum\" with an input property \"list\" of type List and an output property \"sum\" of type Number.\n\nInside this function, I'll instantiate Iteration.Reduce, define the reducer function, set the initial accumulator value, and connect everything appropriately.\n\nI also need to make sure that the function handles empty lists correctly, returning 0 in that case.\n\nLet me consider how to define the reducer function. Since Midio is node-based, I might need to create a separate function node for the reducer.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio allows inline expressions or lambda functions, I could define the reducer directly.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, I see Math.Add, which takes two numbers and returns their sum. Maybe I can use Math.Add directly as the reducer function, with the accumulator and current element as inputs.\n\nWait, but Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes the accumulator and current element and returns the new accumulator value, which is exactly what Math.Add does if the accumulator and current element are numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use Math.Add as the reducer function directly.\n\nLet me think about this: if I connect Math.Add to the 'reducer' input of Iteration.Reduce, with the accumulator connected to 'first' and the current element connected to 'second', then Iteration.Reduce should correctly sum up the list.\n\nI need to confirm whether Iteration.Reduce can directly use Math.Add in this manner.\n\nAssuming that's possible, my setup would be:\n\n- Instance of Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Connect 'items' to the input list\n\n- Set 'initial_value' to 0\n\n- Connect 'reducer' to Math.Add\n\n- The result of Iteration.Reduce would be the sum, which I can output.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Now, I need to ensure that if the list is empty, Iteration.Reduce returns the initial value, which is 0, as expected.\n\nI should also consider performance, but for now, since this is likely an internal operation, I won't worry about optimizing it further.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio's syntax.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module and the sum function:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {\n\nin(x: -213, y: 28, name: \"list\") property(List) list_2c62ab\n\nout(x: 567, y: 3, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_2a848f\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 100, y: 100) reduce_e4a7b3 root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\nitems: list_2c62ab\n\ninitial_value: 0\n\nreducer: add_c5f3d1\n\n}\n\ninstance(x: 200, y: 100) add_c5f3d1 root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\n\n\nreduce_e4a7b3.result -> sum_2a848f\n\n}\n\n}\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the reducer function takes two inputs: accumulator and current element.\n\nIn Midio, functions might require specific input connections.\n\nLooking at Math.Add, it takes 'first' and 'second' inputs and produces a 'result'.\n\nSo, in the context of Iteration.Reduce, I need to map the accumulator to 'first' and the current element to 'second'.\n\nI'm not sure if simply assigning 'reducer: add_c5f3d1' is sufficient. Maybe I need to specify how the inputs are connected.\n\nPerhaps I need to use a higher-order function or specify the connections more explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Iteration.Reduce automatically wires the accumulator and current element to the reducer's inputs.\n\nI need to check the documentation for Iteration.Reduce to understand how to connect the reducer function.\n\nAssuming that Iteration.Reduce expects a function that takes two inputs (accumulator and current element), and outputs the new accumulator value, then connecting Math.Add directly should work, as it adds two numbers and produces a sum.\n\nSo, in this case, the accumulator would be the first input to Math.Add, and the current element would be the second input.\n\nThe output of Math.Add would be the new accumulator value.\n\nThis seems correct for summing up a list.\n\nNow, to handle empty lists, I set the initial_value to 0, so if the list is empty, the result should be 0.\n\nI think this covers the basic requirements.\n\nLet me consider testing this function with some example lists:\n\n- [1, 2, 3] should return 6\n\n- [10, 20, 30] should return 60\n\n- [] should return 0\n\n- [5] should return 5\n\nI can mentally verify that the reduce operation with Math.Add and initial value 0 would produce these results.\n\nI don't think I need to handle cases where the list contains non-numeric elements, as per the task description, but if needed, I could add additional checks.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with this implementation.\n\nLet me write the Midio code accordingly.\n\n\nTo create a function in Midio that calculates the sum of an array, you can use the `Iteration.Reduce` function along with `Math.Add`. Here's how you can structure your code:\n\n```midio\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nmodule() main {\n\n    func(doc: \"Finds the sum of an array.\") _sum {"

                "I'm going to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function will take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero).\n\nSo, the steps I need to follow are:\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n2. Iterate through the digits, summing the digits in odd positions and the digits in even positions separately.\n\n3. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n4. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to implement this in Midio. Since Midio is a node-based programming language, I'll need to use various nodes to achieve this functionality.\n\nLet's start by outlining the main components:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n\n- Split the string into individual digits.\n\n- Determine the positions of the digits (odd or even).\n\n- Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n- Calculate the difference between these sums.\n\n- Check if the difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to look up the available nodes in Midio that can help with these tasks. From the list provided, I see nodes for string manipulation, mathematical operations, and control flow.\n\nFirst, to convert the number to a string, I can use the \"Strings.ToString\" node, but it's not listed in the provided external functions. Maybe there's another way to convert a number to a string. Alternatively, since the task is to check divisibility by 11, perhaps there's a mathematical approach without converting to a string.\n\nLet me think about a mathematical approach. One method to check divisibility by 11 is to alternately add and subtract the digits of the number from left to right, and then check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nFor example, for the number 121:\n\n1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 1234:\n\n1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems like a simpler approach that doesn't require converting the number to a string.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum.\n\n2. While the number is greater than zero:\n\na. Add or subtract the last digit from the alternating sum.\n\nb. Remove the last digit from the number.\n\nc. Alternate the sign for the next operation.\n\n3. Check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using loops and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, I see \"Std.For\" which can be used for looping, and mathematical nodes like \"Math.Mod\" for modulo operation, \"Math.Div\" for division, and \"Math.Sub\" for subtraction.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to loop through each digit of the number.\n\n- In each iteration, calculate the last digit using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Add or subtract this digit from the alternating sum based on the current sign.\n\n- Remove the last digit by integer division of the number by 10.\n\n- Alternate the sign for the next iteration.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11 using \"Math.Mod\" with 11 and checking if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but \"Std.For\" typically requires a list or a range to iterate over, which might not be directly applicable here since I need to iterate based on the number of digits in the number.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of digits first and then use \"Std.For\" to loop that many times.\n\nTo find the number of digits, I can convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, string conversion is not straightforward.\n\nAnother mathematical way to find the number of digits is to use logarithms, but I'm not sure if Midio has logarithm functions.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a while loop, where I keep processing the number until it becomes zero, similar to the steps I outlined earlier.\n\nLooking at the provided nodes, there is no direct \"while\" loop, but I can simulate it using \"Std.For\" with a large enough range and early exit conditions.\n\nHowever, this might be inefficient. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use recursion to process each digit one by one.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursive function calls.\n\nLet me consider another approach: since the number can be large, but for practical purposes, let's assume it's within the integer range that Midio handles.\n\nI'll proceed with the loop approach using \"Std.For\" and handle the digits one by one.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Determine the number of digits in the input number.\n\n- As mentioned earlier, this can be done by converting to a string and getting its length, but since string conversion is not straightforward, I'll look for an alternative.\n\n- Alternatively, I can use a loop to repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it becomes zero, counting the number of iterations. This will give me the number of digits.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate from 0 to the number of digits minus one.\n\n3. In each iteration:\n\na. Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\nb. Depending on the position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n4. After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's consider how to implement step 1: finding the number of digits.\n\nI'll need to create a counter that increments each time the number is divided by 10 until it becomes zero.\n\nThis can be done using another \"Std.For\" loop with a large range and an early exit condition, but this might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a function that calculates the number of digits mathematically without looping, but without logarithms, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a lookup table for the number of digits based on the range of the number, but that seems overly complicated.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the number of digits is less than, say, 20, and use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range up to 20, and handle cases where the number has fewer digits.\n\nSo, in the main function, I'll have:\n\n- An input property for the number.\n\n- An output property for the boolean result.\n\n- Instances of various nodes to perform the required operations.\n\nLet me start by defining the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"finds whether a number is divisible by 11.\") is_diff {\n\nin(x: 5, y: -25, name: \"n\") property(Number) n_27f29c\n\nout(x: 668, y: 2, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_f2630f\n\n}\n\nNow, within this function, I need to implement the logic.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of digits in 'n'. Since direct string conversion isn't straightforward, I'll use a loop to count the digits.\n\nI can use \"Std.For\" with a fixed range, say 20 iterations, and in each iteration, check if the number is still greater than zero. If it is, increment the digit count and divide the number by 10.\n\nBut since \"Std.For\" iterates over a list or range, and I need to exit early when the number becomes zero, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can always iterate 20 times and ignore iterations beyond the actual number of digits.\n\nProceeding with this approach:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the digit at the current position.\n\n- Add or subtract it from the alternating sum based on the position.\n\n- Accumulate the alternating sum.\n\n- After the loop, check if the alternating sum is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but \"Iteration.Map\" is typically for transforming lists, not for accumulating a value.\n\nMaybe I need to use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to accumulate the alternating sum.\n\nLooking back at the provided nodes, I see \"Iteration.Aggregate\", which might be suitable for accumulating a value.\n\nBut to use \"Iteration.Aggregate\", I need to provide an initial value and a function that combines the accumulator with each element of the list.\n\nIn this case, the list would be the digits of the number, but since I don't have a straightforward way to get the digits as a list, I need to generate them within the aggregate function.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use a recursive function where I process one digit at a time and pass the accumulated sum and the remaining number to the next recursion.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Midio supports recursion.\n\nGiven these constraints, maybe it's simpler to proceed with the initial plan of using \"Std.For\" with a fixed range and ignoring extra iterations.\n\nHere's how it could work:\n\n- Use \"List.Range\" from 0 to 19.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to process each iteration:\n\n- Calculate the last digit of 'n' using \"Math.Mod\" with 10.\n\n- Depending on the current position (odd or even), add or subtract it from the alternating sum.\n\n- Remove the"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to return a list that contains elements which are unique to each list, meaning elements that are not shared between them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are in A but not in B, combined with those that are in B but not in A. Essentially, it's the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A - B) \u222a (B - A).\n\nMidio seems to have some set operations available, like Sets.Difference. Maybe I can use that to find the differences and then combine them.\n\nLet me look at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Sets.Difference: Returns the difference of two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\n\n- List.Concat: Concatenates two lists.\n\nSo, perhaps I can compute the difference of list1 minus list2, and then the difference of list2 minus list1, and then concatenate those two differences to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to handle that appropriately. Maybe I should treat the lists as sets, so duplicates are ignored.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists,\" and it doesn't specify whether duplicates should be considered or not. Perhaps I should assume that duplicates are possible in the lists, and the output should include duplicates appropriately.\n\nFor example, if list1 is [1, 2, 2, 3] and list2 is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4]. Notice that 2 appears twice in list1, but in the symmetric difference, it appears once because it's present in both lists.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if my understanding of handling duplicates is correct. In set theory, sets don't have duplicates, so symmetric difference doesn't consider multiples. But since we're dealing with lists, which can have duplicates, perhaps the output should reflect the counts appropriately.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of list operations rather than set operations.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nlist1: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nlist2: [2, 3, 4]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be elements that are unique to each list.\n\nSo, elements in list1 not in list2: [1, 2]\n\nElements in list2 not in list1: [4]\n\nThen, combining these: [1, 2, 4]\n\nBut in list1, 2 appears twice, but in list2, 2 appears only once. So, the dissimilar elements should have one 2, because one 2 is shared.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother way is to compute the union of the two lists and then remove the intersection. That would give me the elements that are not common to both lists.\n\nSo, union(A, B) - intersection(A, B)\n\nThat's another way to compute the symmetric difference.\n\nBut in Midio, I need to find instances or functions that can compute union and intersection.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions:\n\n- Sets.Intersection: Returns the intersection of two input lists.\n\n- List.Union: Not listed, so maybe not available?\n\nIf List.Union is not available, I might need to implement union using other operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Sets.Difference function twice and then concatenate the results.\n\nSo, (list1 - intersection(list1, list2)) concatenated with (list2 - intersection(list1, list2))\n\nThat should give me the symmetric difference.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nI need to create a function called find_dissimilar with two inputs: list1 and list2 of type List, and an output output of type List.\n\nInside the function, I'll need to:\n\n1. Compute the intersection of list1 and list2.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list1 minus the intersection.\n\n3. Compute the difference of list2 minus the intersection.\n\n4. Concatenate the results of step 2 and step 3 to get the final output.\n\nSo, I'll need three instances: two Sets.Difference and one List.Concat.\n\nAlso, one Sets.Intersection to find the common elements.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Instance intersection (Sets.Intersection) with left connected to list1 and right connected to list2.\n\n- Instance difference1 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list1 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance difference2 (Sets.Difference) with left connected to list2 and right connected to intersection.intersection.\n\n- Instance concat (List.Concat) with left connected to difference1.difference and right connected to difference2.difference.\n\n- Connect concat.list to output.\n\nThis should give me the symmetric difference of list1 and list2.\n\nLet me consider if there's a more efficient way or if there are built-in functions that can do this in fewer steps.\n\nLooking back at the external functions, there's no direct symmetric difference function, so this seems like the way to go.\n\nI should also think about the types of the lists. Are they lists of integers, strings, or any type? Midio seems to have a generic List type, so perhaps it can handle any type.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the lists contain comparable elements, whatever that means in Midio.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the Sets.Difference function handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nIf list1 has duplicates, and list2 has some of those duplicates, how does Sets.Difference handle them?\n\nI need to check the documentation for Sets.Difference to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nLooking back, the documentation says: \"Returns the difference of the two input lists, left and right, through the difference output.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how duplicates are handled. Maybe it removes duplicates or preserves them.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume that Sets.Difference preserves duplicates from the left list unless they are present in the right list.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should just proceed with the assumption that Sets.Difference works appropriately for lists with duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, if Sets.Difference doesn't handle duplicates as desired, maybe I need to preprocess the lists to remove duplicates before computing the intersection and differences.\n\nBut that would add more complexity, and the problem didn't specify how to handle duplicates, so perhaps it's acceptable to handle them in whatever way Sets.Difference handles them.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the initial plan.\n\nLet me also consider if there are any edge cases:\n\n- If either list is empty, the dissimilar elements should be the non-empty list.\n\n- If both lists are empty, the dissimilar elements should be an empty list.\n\n- If both lists are identical, the dissimilar elements should be an empty list.\n\n- If there are duplicates, handle them according to Sets.Difference behavior.\n\nI need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function is efficient enough for large lists, but since Midio is a graphical programming language, efficiency might not be my primary concern here.\n\nAssuming that the Sets.Difference and List.Concat functions are optimized, my implementation should be fine.\n\nNow, I need to translate this into Midio code.\n\nGiven that, here's how the function would look:\n\nfunc(doc: \"find the dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\") find_dissimilar {\n\nin(x: -531, y: 2, name: \"list1\") property(List) list1_ai\n\nin(x: -165, y: 68, name: \"list2\") property(List) list2_ai\n\nout(x: 340, y: 77, name: \"output\") property(List) output_ai\n\n\n\ninstance(x: -121, y: -71) intersection_78d487 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Intersection {}\n\nlist1_ai -> intersection_78d487.left\n\nlist2_ai -> intersection_78d487.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 169, y: -77) difference1_cd5cc4 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Difference {}\n\nlist1_ai -> difference1_cd5cc4.left\n\nintersection_78d487.intersection -> difference1_cd5cc4.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 169, y: 100) difference2_cd5cc4 root.Std_k98ojb.Sets.Difference {}\n\nlist2_ai -> difference2_cd5cc4.left\n\nintersection_78d487.intersection -> difference2_cd5cc4.right\n\n\n\ninstance(x: 300, y: 15) concat_abc123 root.Std_k98ojb.List.Concat {}\n\ndifference1_cd5cc4.difference -> concat_abc123.left\n\ndifference2_cd5cc4.difference -> concat_abc123.right\n\n\n\nconcat_abc123.list -> output_ai\n\n}\n\nThis should accomplish the task of finding dissimilar elements between two lists by computing their symmetric difference"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. So, if one is positive and the other is negative, it should return true; otherwise, false. I need to make sure that this works correctly for any integer values, including zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to have opposite signs. If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. However, if both are positive or both are negative, they do not have opposite signs. Also, if either or both of the numbers are zero, since zero is neither positive nor negative, I need to decide how to handle that case.\n\nIn most programming contexts, zero is considered non-negative. So, if one number is zero and the other is positive, they don't have opposite signs. Similarly, if one is zero and the other is negative, they don't have opposite signs. If both are zero, they obviously don't have opposite signs.\n\nSo, my function needs to return true only when one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nNow, how can I implement this in Midio? I need to use the available external functions to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions, I see that there are mathematical and logical operations available. Specifically, there's a \"Math.Expression\" function that can evaluate expressions like \"a < 0 && b >= 0\" or similar conditions.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to multiply the two numbers. If the product is negative, then they have opposite signs. If the product is positive, they have the same sign. If the product is zero, then at least one of them is zero.\n\nWait, but multiplication can overflow if the numbers are very large in magnitude. Although in Midio, I assume that number types can handle large values, but still, it's something to consider.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the sign of each number individually and then see if they are different.\n\nIn programming terms, for integers, the sign can be checked using comparison operators. For example, if x < 0, it's negative; if x >= 0, it's non-negative.\n\nSo, I can check if (x < 0 && y >= 0) || (x >= 0 && y < 0). If this condition is true, then the numbers have opposite signs.\n\nIn Midio, I can use logical operators to construct this condition.\n\nLooking at the external functions, there's \"Logic.And\" and \"Logic.Or\" that can be used to combine conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up two \"Logic.And\" instances:\n\n1. One with (x < 0) and (y >= 0)\n\n2. Another with (x >= 0) and (y < 0)\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Or\" to combine the results of these two \"And\" operations.\n\nBut to check if x < 0, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" function, and similarly for y >= 0 using \"Math.GreaterThanOrEqual\".\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Maybe it's \"Math.LessThan\"?\n\nActually, in the list provided, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Hmm.\n\nWait, here's \"Math.LessThan\": \"Checks if 'left' is less than 'right'\"\n\nYes, there is \"Math.LessThan\".\n\nSo, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" for x < 0 and \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\" for y >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition.\n\nSo, let's sketch this out.\n\nI need:\n\n- Check if x < 0 (using Math.LessThan with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y >= 0 (using Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Check if x >= 0 (Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y < 0 (Math.LessThan with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nThen, combine the two \"And\" results with \"Logic.Or\" to get the final output.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the case when either x or y is zero.\n\nIf x is zero and y is positive, then (x >= 0 && y < 0) is false, and (x < 0 && y >= 0) is false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if both are zero, both conditions are false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nIf x is positive and y is negative, one condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nIf x is negative and y is positive, the other condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nSeems good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplication approach:\n\nMultiply x and y, and check if the result is negative.\n\nBut this might have issues with overflow for large integers, although in Midio, numbers might be handled differently.\n\nAlso, multiplying two large numbers could be less efficient than simple comparisons.\n\nSo, stick with the comparison-based approach.\n\nNow, to implement this in Midio, I need to set up the instances accordingly.\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\nI need to create instances for:\n\n- Math.LessThan for x < 0\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for y >= 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nSimilarly for the other condition:\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for x >= 0\n\n- Math.LessThan for y < 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nThen, Logic.Or to combine the two And results.\n\nFinally, connect the output to the output property.\n\nI need to make sure that the connections are correct, i.e., the outputs of the conditions are connected to the Logic.And inputs, and the outputs of the Logic.And instances are connected to the Logic.Or inputs, and finally, the Logic.Or output is connected to the final output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the input properties x and y are connected to the respective Math functions.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out in code format.\n\nFirst, import the standard library:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the function, create the instances.\n\nInstance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: some_x, y: some_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, in Midio, instance connections are made via arrows, and properties are connected.\n\nSo, actually, I need to define instances and connect their inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's try.\n\nFirst, create an instance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThan_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThan_x.right\n\nSimilarly, for y >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, actually, for y >= 0, it's y >= 0, so left: y, right: 0\n\nThen, connect y_5390f5 to lessThanOrEqual_y.left\n\nAnd constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_y.right\n\nThen, create a Logic.And instance to combine these two:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) and1 root.Std_k98ojb.Logic.And {\n\nin1: lessThan_x.result\n\nin2: lessThanOrEqual_y.result\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition:\n\nx >= 0 and y < 0\n\nSo, x >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThanOrEqual_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_x.right\n\nAnd y < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect y_5390f5 to less"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function should take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero.\n\nSo, for example, take the number 121:\n\n- Positions are counted from left to right, starting with position 1 as odd.\n\n- Digits: 1 (position 1, odd), 2 (position 2, even), 1 (position 3, odd).\n\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum of digits in even positions: 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example, number 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even), 9 (odd)\n\n- Sum odd: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum even: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n1. Take an input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n3. Iterate through each digit, keeping track of whether its position is odd or even.\n\n4. Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\n7. Output true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI need to implement this logic using Midio nodes. I'll likely need nodes for string manipulation, math operations, loops, and conditionals.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n- First, I need to convert the number to a string so I can iterate through each digit.\n\n- Then, I need to iterate through each character in the string, determining its position (odd or even).\n\n- For each digit, add it to the appropriate sum (odd or even).\n\n- After processing all digits, calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- Finally, check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers. The divisibility rule should work the same way regardless of the sign, so I can take the absolute value of the number before processing.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the input is zero. Zero is divisible by any non-zero number, including 11, so the function should return true for n=0.\n\nLet me outline the steps again, considering edge cases:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number to handle negatives.\n\n2. Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.\n\n3. Initialize two sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. Determine the position (odd or even based on index).\n\nb. Convert the character to a number.\n\nc. Add to the appropriate sum based on position.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the sums of odd and even positions.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11:\n\na. If the difference modulo 11 is 0, then it's divisible.\n\n7. Output true if divisible, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in programming, the modulo operator can be used to check divisibility. If a number modulo 11 equals zero, then it's divisible by 11.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the difference is divisible by 11, which includes negative differences, but since I'm taking the absolute value earlier, all differences should be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Midio:\n\n- I'll need a node to convert the number to a string.\n\n- A loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n\n- Conditionals to determine if the position is odd or even.\n\n- Math nodes to sum the digits accordingly.\n\n- A node to calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- A node to check if this difference is divisible by 11 using the modulo operation.\n\nI should also consider the efficiency, but since we're dealing with numbers that have a reasonable number of digits, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram of the nodes:\n\n- Start with the input number.\n\n- Connect to an \"absolute value\" math node.\n\n- Connect to a \"toString\" conversion node.\n\n- Connect to a \"split string\" node to get an array of characters.\n\n- Connect to a \"for each\" loop node.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get the index and character.\n\n- Determine if the index is odd or even.\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Add to odd sum or even sum based on position.\n\n- After the loop, subtract even sum from odd sum.\n\n- Take the absolute value of the difference.\n\n- Use modulo operator with 11.\n\n- Check if the result is 0.\n\n- Output true if yes, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the divisibility rule, we take the difference between sums of digits in odd and even positions, and check if that difference is divisible by 11. It's not necessary to take the absolute value of the difference because zero is considered divisible, and negative numbers are also considered divisible if their positive counterparts are.\n\nSo, in the modulo operation, both positive and negative differences that are multiples of 11 will yield zero.\n\nBut in programming, the modulo operator for negative numbers can behave differently depending on the language. In some languages, -11 modulo 11 is 0, but I need to confirm how Midio handles this.\n\nTo be safe, I can take the absolute value of the difference before applying the modulo operation.\n\nAlso, considering that the input can be a floating-point number, but for divisibility rules, we typically deal with integers. So, I should ensure that the input is an integer. If it's a float, I might need to truncate or round it to an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a number,\" not necessarily an integer. However, divisibility by 11 is generally defined for integers. So, I'll assume that the input is an integer.\n\nI should add a check to ensure that the input is an integer, and if not, perhaps round it to the nearest integer or return an error.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me also consider the case when the input is zero, as mentioned earlier. Zero should return true.\n\nAnother consideration is the sign of the number. Since divisibility is not affected by the sign, I can ignore the sign by taking the absolute value.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string.\n\n3. Split the string into an array of characters.\n\n4. Initialize two variables: sumOdd and sumEven to zero.\n\n5. Iterate through the array with indices:\n\na. For each character, convert it back to a number.\n\nb. If the index is odd, add to sumOdd; if even, add to sumEven.\n\n6. Calculate difference = sumOdd - sumEven.\n\n7. Compute abs(difference) % 11.\n\n8. If the result is zero, output true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in programming, array indices usually start at 0, which is even. But in our position count, we considered position 1 as odd.\n\nSo, to match positions:\n\n- Index 0 in the array corresponds to position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 corresponds to position 2 (even).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\n- For each character at index i:\n\n- If i is even (0, 2, 4,...), it's in an odd position.\n\n- If i is odd (1, 3, 5,...), it's in an even position.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nIn programming, array indices start at 0.\n\nBut positions in the number start at 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Character at index 0 is position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 is position 2 (even).\n\n- Index 2 is position 3 (odd).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, to determine if a position is odd or even:\n\n- If the index is even, position is odd.\n\n- If the index is odd, position is even.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, it's an odd position.\n\n- Else, even position.\n\nWait, but in programming terms:\n\n- Index 0 (even index) corresponds to odd position.\n\n- Index 1 (odd index) corresponds to even position.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the loop, I need to check if the index is even or odd to determine the position.\n\nNow, in Midio, how do I iterate through a string with indices?\n\nI think there's a way to get both the index and the value in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the string to an array of characters and iterate through it with indices.\n\nAssuming Midio has a \"for each with index\" loop, I can use that"

                "I'm going to attempt to solve this task in Midio. The task is to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. So, I need to take a list of numbers, find the unique ones, and then multiply them together to get the product.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. It means that if there are duplicates in the list, I should only consider one instance of each number for the product. For example, if the list is [2, 3, 3, 4], the unique numbers are 2, 3, and 4, and their product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nIn Midio, I need to design a flow that accomplishes this. I'll need to:\n\n1. Take the input list.\n\n2. Remove duplicates to get unique numbers.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n4. Output the result.\n\nLet's think about how to implement each step.\n\n**Step 1: Take the input list.**\n\nI have an input property called \"list\" of type List, which I assume contains numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Remove duplicates to get unique numbers.**\n\nTo remove duplicates from a list, I can use a set, since sets automatically handle uniqueness. However, in Midio, I need to see what functions are available for lists and sets.\n\nLooking at the external functions provided, I see \"Sets.Difference\" and \"Sets.Intersection\", but nothing that directly creates a set from a list or removes duplicates. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the \"List.Contains\" function in combination with some looping mechanism to build a new list of unique numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to iterate through the list and collect only unique items.\n\nLet me think about using the \"Iteration.Filter\" function. I can filter the list by checking if an item has already been included in the result list.\n\nTo do this, I would need to keep track of items that have already been seen. Maybe using another list to store seen items.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n- Initialize an empty list to store unique numbers.\n\n- Iterate through the input list.\n\n- For each number, check if it's already in the unique list.\n\n- If not, add it to the unique list.\n\n- Once all items are processed, proceed to calculate the product.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's a node-based system, I need to represent this logic using nodes and their connections.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the product of these unique numbers.**\n\nOnce I have the unique list, I can use the \"Iteration.Reduce\" function to multiply all the numbers together.\n\nThe reduce function can apply a binary operation cumulatively to the items of the list, so I can use it to multiply them.\n\nI need to set the initial value of the accumulator to 1, since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.\n\n**Step 4: Output the result.**\n\nFinally, I need to output the result through the \"output\" property.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to create a function named \"unique_product\" with the specified inputs and outputs.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to:\n\n- Have an input trigger \"execute\" to start the process.\n\n- Take the \"list\" input property.\n\n- Process the list to get unique numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n- Set the \"output\" property with the result.\n\n- Trigger the \"continue\" output when done.\n\nI need to ensure that the flow is correctly connected so that operations happen in the right order.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. A starting trigger node (\"execute\").\n\n2. A node to generate unique numbers from the list.\n\n3. A node to calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n4. A node to set the \"output\" property with the result.\n\n5. A node to trigger \"continue\" when everything is done.\n\nBut since Midio is a visual programming environment, I need to represent this logic using nodes and their connections.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter unique numbers.\n\nWait, but filter typically excludes items based on a condition, whereas I want to include only unique items.\n\nMaybe I need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can sort the list and then remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nBut looking at the provided functions, I see \"List.Sort\" which can sort the list.\n\nAfter sorting, identical numbers will be adjacent, and then I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" to remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n- Sort the input list.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to keep only the items that are not equal to the previous item.\n\n- Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to multiply all the items in this filtered list.\n\n- Set the output property with the result.\n\n- Trigger \"continue\".\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet's think about the details.\n\nFirst, I need to sort the list. I can use the \"List.Sort\" function.\n\nThen, I need to filter out consecutive duplicates.\n\nFor that, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a predicate that checks if the current item is equal to the previous item.\n\nHowever, in Midio, functions might not have direct access to previous items, so I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each item is paired with the previous item, and then filter based on whether they are equal.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a list of unique items.\n\nIn the reduce function, I can accumulate a list, and only add the current item if it's not already in the accumulated list.\n\nThen, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to calculate the product of this unique list.\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nSo, in more detail:\n\n- Use \"List.Empty\" to create an empty list.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with the input list and the initial accumulator set to the empty list.\n\n- In the reducer function, check if the current item is in the accumulated list.\n\n- If not, add it to the accumulated list.\n\n- Finally, after reduction, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to multiply all items in the unique list, starting with 1.\n\n- Set the output property with the product.\n\n- Trigger \"continue\".\n\nBut I need to make sure that the reducer function can handle adding items to a list and checking for existence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe I can use \"Sets.Difference\" to get unique items.\n\nBut \"Sets.Difference\" is for getting elements in one set minus another.\n\nHmm.\n\nActually, to get unique items, I might need to implement a custom function.\n\nGiven the constraints of Midio's provided functions, it seems a bit tricky, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, create the sorted list using \"List.Sort\".\n\nThen, use \"Iteration.Filter\" to remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nFor the filter predicate, I need to have access to the previous item.\n\nI'm not sure if Midio's \"Iteration.Filter\" provides the previous item.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Map\" to pair each item with its index and then filter based on whether the current item is equal to the next one.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use \"List.Contains\" within the filter predicate.\n\nSo, for each item, check if it's already in the accumulated list of unique items.\n\nBut for that, I need to maintain the accumulated list somehow.\n\nIn Midio, since it's a node-based system, maintaining state across iterations is challenging.\n\nMaybe I need to use a counter or some looping mechanism.\n\nWait, perhaps using \"Std.For\" loop can help.\n\n\"Std.For\" allows iteration over a list.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over the sorted list.\n\n- For each item, check if it's already in the unique list.\n\n- If not, add it to the unique list.\n\n- After the loop, calculate the product.\n\nBut I need to manage the unique list across iterations, which might require using instance variables or some form of accumulator.\n\nI need to see how \"Std.For\" handles accumulators.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a list accumulator.\n\nLet me look for a \"List.Contains\" function to check if an item is already in the accumulator list.\n\nAssuming I can use \"List.Contains\", I can create a reducer that adds the current item to the accumulator only if it's not already present.\n\nThen, after reduction, I'll have a list of unique items.\n\nFinally, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to calculate the product.\n\nThis seems workable.\n\nSo, in code terms, it would look like:\n\nunique_list = reduce(list, [], func(accumulator, item):\n\n    if not List.Contains(accumulator, item):\n\n        return append(accumulator, item)\n\n    else:\n\n        return accumulator\n\n)\n\nproduct = reduce(unique_list, 1, func(acc, item): acc * item)\n\noutput = product\n\ncontinue()\n\nNow, I need to translate this logic into Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to create instances for \"List.Sort\", \"Iteration.Reduce\" for uniqueness, another \"Iteration.Reduce\" for product, and set the output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the flow is triggered correctly from \"execute\" to \"continue\".\n\nGiven the complexity, I might need to break it down into smaller functions, but since the task is to create a single function, I need to manage it within the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the \"Sets\" functions"

                "I need to create a Midio function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. The function should take two inputs: a list and a number indicating how many positions to rotate the list to the right. The output should be the rotated list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to rotate a list to the right by n positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last n elements are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the effective rotation number by taking n modulo the length of the list, since rotating by the length of the list would result in the same list.\n\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the remaining elements.\n\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI need to handle cases where n is larger than the list length, negative, or zero. Using the modulo operation will help handle cases where n is larger than the list length. If n is zero, the list remains unchanged. If n is negative, it would typically mean rotating to the left, but since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume n is non-negative.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to use the available external functions to manipulate lists and perform necessary operations.\n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n- Calculate the effective rotation number: rotation = n % list_length\n\n- If rotation is zero, output the original list\n\n- Otherwise, split the list into two parts:\n\n- Part1: last 'rotation' elements\n\n- Part2: the remaining elements from the start to list_length - rotation\n\n- Concatenate part1 and part2 to get the rotated list\n\nI need to find Midio functions that can help me with these operations.\n\nLooking at the provided external functions, I see:\n\n- List.Length: to get the length of the list\n\n- List.Slice: to get a slice of the list from start to end indices\n\n- List.Concat: to concatenate two lists\n\n- Math.Modulo: to calculate n modulo list_length\n\nSo, I can use List.Length to get the list length, Math.Modulo to calculate the effective rotation, and List.Slice to get the two parts of the list. Then, use List.Concat to combine them.\n\nLet me think about how to use List.Slice. List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nTo get the last 'rotation' elements, I can slice from list_length - rotation to list_length.\n\nTo get the remaining elements, I can slice from 0 to list_length - rotation.\n\nThen, concatenate the two slices in reverse order: part1 (last rotation elements) + part2 (remaining elements).\n\nI need to handle the case where rotation is zero by directly outputting the original list.\n\nAlso, need to handle empty lists or n=0 scenarios.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio nodes.\n\nFirst, get the list length using List.Length.\n\nThen, calculate effective rotation: rotation = n % list_length\n\nIf rotation is zero, output the original list.\n\nElse, proceed to slice and concatenate.\n\nTo implement the condition, I can use Std.If or Logic.Equal for checking if rotation is zero.\n\nAssuming I use Std.If, I can have:\n\n- Condition: rotation == 0\n\n- If true: output the original list\n\n- If false: perform the slicing and concatenation\n\nSo, I need to create nodes for:\n\n1. List.Length to get list_length\n\n2. Math.Modulo to compute rotation = n % list_length\n\n3. Std.If to check if rotation == 0\n\n4. If true: output the original list\n\n5. If false:\n\na. Calculate start_index_for_part1 = list_length - rotation\n\nb. Use List.Slice to get part1 from start_index_for_part1 to list_length\n\nc. Use List.Slice to get part2 from 0 to start_index_for_part1\n\nd. Use List.Concat to concatenate part1 and part2\n\ne. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly calculated and handled.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where list_length is zero, but in such cases, rotating by any n would result in the same empty list.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=2\n\nlist_length = 5\n\nrotation = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nstart_index_for_part1 = 5 - 2 = 3\n\npart1 = slice from 3 to 5 -> [4, 5]\n\npart2 = slice from 0 to 3 -> [1, 2, 3]\n\nconcatenated = [4, 5] + [1, 2, 3] -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=5\n\nrotation = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nSo, output the original list.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=7\n\nrotation = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nSame as first example, output [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nList: [1, 2, 3], n=1\n\nrotation = 1 % 3 = 1\n\nstart_index_for_part1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\npart1 = slice from 2 to 3 -> [3]\n\npart2 = slice from 0 to 2 -> [1, 2]\n\nconcatenated = [3] + [1, 2] -> [3, 1, 2]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2], n=0\n\nrotation = 0 % 2 = 0\n\nOutput original list [1, 2]\n\nList: [], n=0\n\nrotation = 0 % 0 = NaN? Need to handle division by zero.\n\nActually, in programming, modulo operation with zero should return the number itself or throw an error. In Midio, I need to see how Math.Modulo handles n % 0.\n\nAssuming it returns n or throws an error, I need to handle this case to output the original list, which is empty.\n\nTo make the function robust, I should consider that if the list is empty, regardless of n, the output should be the empty list.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nif list_length == 0:\n\noutput = []\n\nelse:\n\nrotation = n % list_length\n\nif rotation == 0:\n\noutput = original_list\n\nelse:\n\nstart_index = list_length - rotation\n\npart1 = list[start_index : list_length]\n\npart2 = list[0 : start_index]\n\noutput = part1 + part2\n\nIn Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available functions.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need to create instances for:\n\n- List.Length to get list_length\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute rotation = n % list_length\n\n- Std.If to check if rotation == 0\n\n- List.Slice to get part1 and part2\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate part1 and part2\n\nAlso, need to calculate start_index = list_length - rotation\n\nFor that, I can use Math.Subtract: start_index = list_length - rotation\n\nSo, add Math.Subtract for this calculation.\n\nNow, let's think about the data flow:\n\n1. list -> List.Length -> list_length\n\n2. n and list_length -> Math.Modulo -> rotation\n\n3. rotation and 0 -> Logic.Equal -> condition\n\n4. Std.If:\n\n- If true (rotation == 0): output = original_list\n\n- If false:\n\na. list_length and rotation -> Math.Subtract -> start_index\n\nb. list and start_index and list_length -> List.Slice -> part1\n\nc. list and 0 and start_index -> List.Slice -> part2\n\nd. part1 and part2 -> List.Concat -> output\n\n5. Std.If.output -> output_823209\n\nI need to make sure that the List.Slice nodes receive the correct start and end indices.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice probably takes list, start, and end as inputs.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where start_index is negative, but since rotation is n % list_length, and list_length is positive, start_index should always be non-negative.\n\nWait, if list_length is 5 and rotation is 2, start_index is 3. If list_length is 3 and rotation is 2, start_index is 1. So, no negative indices.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that start_index is less than or equal to list_length.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to define a function with inputs list and n, and output output.\n\nI'll need to create instances for the required functions and connect them appropriately.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the nodes and connections:\n\n- List.Length instance:\n\ninput: list\n\noutput: list_length\n\n- Math.Modulo instance:\n\ninputs: n, list_length\n\noutput: rotation\n\n- Logic.Equal instance:\n\ninputs: rotation, 0\n\noutput: condition\n\n- Std.If instance:\n\ncondition: condition\n\nif true:\n\noutput: original_list\n\nif false:\n\n- Math.Subtract instance:\n\ninputs"

So, to check if a number is prime, I need to verify that it's greater than 1 and that it's only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nIn Midio, I'll need to set up a function with an input for the number to check and an output for the result. I might also need some control flow nodes to perform the checks.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Check if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it's not prime.\n\n2. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any of these divisions have no remainder, then it's not prime.\n\n3. If none of the divisions have a remainder, then it's prime.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio. I'll need nodes for comparison, looping, and possibly mathematical operations like division and square roots.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see nodes like Std.If, Math.Expression, Iteration.Map, List.GenerateRange, etc. I think I can use List.GenerateRange to generate a list of potential divisors and then check if any of them divide the number evenly.\n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number (inclusive).\n\n- Use Iteration.Map to check for each divisor in the list whether it divides the input number without a remainder.\n\n- If any divisor divides the number without a remainder, the number is not prime.\n\n- If no such divisor is found, the number is prime.\n\nI need to handle the case where the input number is less than or equal to 1 separately, as those are not prime by definition.\n\nAlso, I need to calculate the square root of the input number.

                "I need to create a Midio function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. The function should take two inputs: a list and a number indicating how many positions to rotate the list to the right. The output should be the rotated list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to rotate a list to the right by n positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last n elements are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the effective rotation number by taking n modulo the length of the list, since rotating by the length of the list would result in the same list.\n\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the preceding elements.\n\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI need to handle cases where n is larger than the list length, negative, or zero. Using the modulo operation will help handle cases where n is larger than the list length. For negative n, rotating to the right by a negative number is equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value of n.\n\nHowever, since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume n is non-negative. If n can be negative, I need to handle left rotations as well, but for now, I'll focus on positive n.\n\nLet's consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 2\n\nEffective rotation: 2\n\nSplit the list into [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5]\n\nConcatenate as [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 0\n\nEffective rotation: 0\n\nNo change, list remains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 5\n\nEffective rotation: 0 (since 5 mod 5 = 0)\n\nList remains the same.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- To calculate the effective rotation: n modulo list length.\n\n- To split the list into two parts at the specified rotation point.\n\n- To concatenate these parts in reverse order.\n\nPotential nodes to use:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute n mod list length.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nSteps in Midio:\n\n1. Get the length of the list using List.Length.\n\n2. Compute effective rotation: n mod list length using Math.Modulo.\n\n3. If effective rotation is 0, output the original list.\n\n4. Otherwise, split the list into two parts:\n\n- First part: from index 0 to list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Second part: from list length - effective rotation to the end.\n\n5. Concatenate the second part and the first part.\n\nI need to handle cases where the list is empty or n is 0.\n\nIf the list is empty, rotating it any number of times should return an empty list.\n\nIf n is 0, the list remains unchanged.\n\nAlso, if n is equal to the list length, it's equivalent to no rotation.\n\nI should ensure that the function doesn't modify the original list but creates a new rotated list.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the function with inputs for list and n, and output for the rotated list.\n\nThen, I'll add a node to get the length of the list.\n\nNext, compute effective rotation: n mod list length.\n\nThen, use List.Slice to get the two parts:\n\n- First part: slice from 0 to list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Second part: slice from list length - effective rotation to the end.\n\nFinally, concatenate the second part and the first part.\n\nI need to connect these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case when the effective rotation is 0 by directly outputting the original list.\n\nTo do this, I can use a conditional statement: if effective rotation == 0, output the original list; else, perform the rotation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use Std.If for conditional execution.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate effective rotation: n mod list length.\n\n2. Use Std.If to check if effective rotation == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to rotate the list.\n\n3. If rotating:\n\na. Slice the list into two parts.\n\nb. Concatenate them in reverse order.\n\nc. Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that all operations are connected correctly and that the data flows properly.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n- List.Length to get the list length.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute n mod list length.\n\n- Std.If to handle the condition when effective rotation is 0.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nI need to connect:\n\n- list -> List.Length -> modulo -> Std.If condition.\n\n- n -> modulo.\n\n- Std.If true branch: output the original list.\n\n- Std.If false branch: perform slicing and concatenation, then output the result.\n\nAlso, in the false branch:\n\n- Calculate the split index: list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get the first part: from 0 to split index.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get the second part: from split index to the end.\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate second part and first part.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to ensure that the indices are correctly calculated for slicing.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices.\n\nStart is inclusive, end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for the first part: start=0, end=split index.\n\nFor the second part: start=split index, end=list length.\n\nThen, concatenate second part + first part.\n\nLet me consider an example in Midio:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 2\n\nList.Length: 5\n\neffective rotation: 2 mod 5 = 2\n\nsplit index: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nfirst part: slice 0 to 3 -> [1, 2, 3]\n\nsecond part: slice 3 to 5 -> [4, 5]\n\nconcatenate second part + first part: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 0\n\neffective rotation: 0 mod 5 = 0\n\noutput original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 5\n\neffective rotation: 5 mod 5 = 0\n\noutput original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 3\n\neffective rotation: 3 mod 5 = 3\n\nsplit index: 5 - 3 = 2\n\nfirst part: slice 0 to 2 -> [1, 2]\n\nsecond part: slice 2 to 5 -> [3, 4, 5]\n\nconcatenate second part + first part: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: []\n\nn: 2\n\neffective rotation: 2 mod 0 = undefined?\n\nWait, modulo by zero is undefined.\n\nIn practice, list length is zero, so effective rotation should be zero.\n\nBut in programming, modulo by zero might return zero or raise an error.\n\nIn Midio, I need to handle the case when list length is zero.\n\nI should check if list length is zero, and if so, output an empty list without rotating.\n\nSo, modify the condition:\n\nIf list length == 0 or effective rotation == 0, output the original list.\n\nElse, perform the rotation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use another Std.If to handle this.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps in Midio, n mod 0 returns 0, so effective rotation would be zero, which is correct.\n\nI need to verify how Math.Modulo handles division by zero.\n\nAssuming Math.Modulo(n, 0) returns 0, then effective rotation would be zero, and the function would correctly output the original list.\n\nIf Math.Modulo(n, 0) raises an error, I need to handle that case separately.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume Math.Modulo handles division by zero gracefully, returning 0.\n\nOtherwise, I might need to add an extra condition to check if list length is zero.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the assumption that Math.Modulo(n, 0) = 0.\n\nSo, my function will be:\n\nfunc rotate_right(list: List, n: Number) -> List {\n\n    length = List.Length(list)\n\n    effective_rotation = Math.Modulo(n, length)\n\n    if effective_rotation == 0 {\n\n        return list\n\n    } else {\n\n        split_index = length - effective_rotation"

                "I've been working on this problem of checking whether a given integer is a prime number. It's a classic problem in programming, and I want to make sure I approach it correctly using Midio.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, to check if a number is prime, I need to verify that it's not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\nIn Midio, I'll need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it's prime or not. I also need to handle the execution trigger and output the result.\n\nI think I can start by checking if the number is less than 2, in which case it's not prime. Then, I can iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number and check if any of these numbers divide the input number evenly. If I find any such divisor, the number is not prime.\n\nI recall that iterating up to the square root of the number is sufficient because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a factor smaller than its square root.\n\nSo, in Midio, I'll need to set up a loop that goes from 2 to the square root of the input number. For each iterator, I'll check if the input number is divisible by it. If it is, then the number is not prime.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the input number is 2, which is prime, and other edge cases like negative numbers or non-integer inputs, but for simplicity, I'll assume the input is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Check if the number is less than 2. If so, it's not prime.\n\n2. If the number is 2, it's prime.\n\n3. For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n\n4. If any divisor is found, it's not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available nodes.\n\nI see there's a \"Std.For\" node that can be used for looping. I'll need to generate a list of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number. To get the square root, I might need to use a mathematical expression node.\n\nWait, I look through the list of external functions, and I see \"Math.Sqrt\" is not directly listed. Maybe I can use \"Math.Pow\" to calculate the square root by raising to the power of 0.5.\n\nSo, to get the square root of a number, I can use Math.Pow(input, 0.5).\n\nThen, I need to generate a list of numbers from 2 up to that square root value. Since the list needs to be integers, I might need to floor the square root value.\n\nI can use \"Math.Floor\" to get the largest integer less than or equal to the square root.\n\nWait, scanning the list again, I don't see \"Math.Floor\" either. Maybe I need to find another way to get an integer value for the upper limit of my loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate a range from 2 to the square root and then map it to integers, but this might complicate things.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a for loop that starts at 2 and increments by 1 until some condition is met.\n\nWait, looking back at the \"Std.For\" node, it seems to iterate over a list of items. So, I need to generate a list of potential divisors.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.GenerateRange\" from 2 to the square root (inclusive), and then iterate over this list.\n\nBut again, I need to ensure that the upper limit is an integer.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the square root using Math.Pow and then cast it to an integer by truncating the decimal part.\n\nIn Midio, is there a way to cast a number to integer? Or perhaps I can use \"Math.Floor\" somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the \"Math.Floor\" function if it's available, or maybe implement it using other mathematical operations.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with integers, I can increment a counter in the loop and check if its square is less than or equal to the input number.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. I can iterate a variable \"i\" from 2 while \"i*i\" is less than or equal to the input number.\n\nIn each iteration, check if the input number is divisible by \"i\". If it is, return false immediately. If no such \"i\" is found, then the number is prime.\n\nThis way, I don't need to generate a list upfront, which might be more efficient.\n\nBut in Midio, since \"Std.For\" seems to work with lists, I might still need to generate a list for iteration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use recursion or some other control structure to implement this logic.\n\nWait, perhaps using a loop with conditions can simulate this behavior.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll need to calculate the square root of the input number and determine the upper limit for checking divisors.\n\nThen, generate a list of potential divisors from 2 up to that upper limit.\n\nThen, iterate over each divisor and check if the input number is divisible by it.\n\nIf any divisor divides the number evenly (i.e., remainder is 0), then the number is not prime.\n\nIf no such divisor is found, then the number is prime.\n\nIn Midio, I can set up a \"Std.For\" loop to iterate over the list of divisors and check the divisibility condition.\n\nI'll need to connect the loop's \"onItem\" event to a condition that checks if the input number is divisible by the current iterator.\n\nIf the condition is true, set the output to false and break out of the loop.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any such divisor, set the output to true.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the input number is less than 2, in which case it's not prime.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider that the input could be a floating-point number, but since the function signature specifies \"Number\", which likely includes floats, I might need to ensure that only integer values are considered.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me start drafting the connections in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll have the \"execute\" trigger connected to a control node that checks if the input number is less than 2. If it is, set the output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\nIf the number is 2, set the output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\nFor numbers greater than 2, proceed to generate the list of potential divisors.\n\nTo generate the list, calculate the square root of the input number using Math.Pow(input, 0.5), then floor it to get the upper limit.\n\nThen, use \"List.GenerateRange\" from 2 to that upper limit.\n\nConnect the generated list to \"Std.For\" loop.\n\nIn the loop's \"onItem\" event, check if the input number modulo the current iterator equals zero.\n\nIf it does, set the output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any such divisor, set the output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\nI need to make sure that the loop can break early once a divisor is found to optimize performance.\n\nIn Midio, does \"Std.For\" allow breaking out of the loop prematurely?\n\nIf not, I might need to manage the loop logic differently, perhaps using a while loop or some other control structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can set a flag when a divisor is found and use that flag to decide the output.\n\nSo, perhaps have a boolean variable initialized to true (assuming the number is prime), and set it to false if any divisor is found.\n\nThen, after the loop completes, set the output based on the value of this flag.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a \"Property\" node to hold this flag state.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Check if input < 2 -> output = false\n\n2. Check if input = 2 -> output = true\n\n3. For input > 2:\n\na. Calculate upper limit as floor(sqrt(input))\n\nb. Generate list from 2 to upper limit\n\nc. Iterate over the list:\n\ni. If input % iterator == 0, set isPrime = false\n\nd. After iteration, output = isPrime\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio's node-based programming model.\n\nI should also consider optimizing the loop by checking divisors only up to the square root, as discussed earlier.\n\nAdditionally, I can skip even numbers after checking 2, but that might complicate things, so I'll keep it simple for now.\n\nLet me try to visualize this in Midio:\n\n- Execute trigger connects to a conditional node that checks if input < 2.\n\n- If true, set output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If false, proceed to another conditional node that checks if input == 2.\n\n- If true, set output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If false, proceed to generate the list of divisors.\n\n- Use Math.Pow to calculate sqrt(input), then floor it (need to figure out how).\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange from 2 to floor(sqrt(input)).\n\n- Connect this list to Std.For loop.\n\n- In the loop's onItem event, check if input % iterator == 0.\n\n- If true, set isPrime = false.\n\n- After loop completes, set output based on isPrime.\n\nI"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. So, if one is positive and the other is negative, it should return true; otherwise, false. I need to make sure that this works correctly for any integer values, including zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for two numbers to have opposite signs. If one number is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. However, if both are positive or both are negative, they do not have opposite signs. Also, if either or both of the numbers are zero, since zero is neither positive nor negative, I need to decide how to handle that case.\n\nIn most programming contexts, zero is considered non-negative. So, if one number is zero and the other is positive, they don't have opposite signs. Similarly, if one is zero and the other is negative, they don't have opposite signs. If both are zero, they obviously don't have opposite signs.\n\nSo, my function needs to return true only when one number is positive and the other is negative.\n\nNow, how can I implement this in Midio? I need to use the available external functions to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions, I see that there are mathematical and logical operations available. Specifically, there's a \"Math.Expression\" function that can evaluate expressions like \"a < 0 && b >= 0\" or similar conditions.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to multiply the two numbers. If the product is negative, then they have opposite signs. If the product is positive, they have the same sign. If the product is zero, then at least one of them is zero.\n\nWait, but multiplication can overflow if the numbers are very large in magnitude. Although in Midio, I assume that number types can handle large values, but still, it's something to consider.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the sign of each number individually and then see if they are different.\n\nIn programming terms, for integers, the sign can be checked using comparison operators. For example, if x < 0, it's negative; if x >= 0, it's non-negative.\n\nSo, I can check if (x < 0 && y >= 0) || (x >= 0 && y < 0). If this condition is true, then the numbers have opposite signs.\n\nIn Midio, I can use logical operators to construct this condition.\n\nLooking at the external functions, there's \"Logic.And\" and \"Logic.Or\" that can be used to combine conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can set up two \"Logic.And\" instances:\n\n1. One with (x < 0) and (y >= 0)\n\n2. Another with (x >= 0) and (y < 0)\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Or\" to combine the results of these two \"And\" operations.\n\nBut to check if x < 0, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" function, and similarly for y >= 0 using \"Math.GreaterThanOrEqual\".\n\nWait, looking back at the list, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Maybe it's \"Math.LessThan\"?\n\nActually, in the list provided, I see \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\", but not \"Math.LessThan\". Hmm.\n\nWait, here's \"Math.LessThan\": \"Checks if 'left' is less than 'right'\"\n\nYes, there is \"Math.LessThan\".\n\nSo, I can use \"Math.LessThan\" for x < 0 and \"Math.LessThanOrEqual\" for y >= 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition.\n\nSo, let's sketch this out.\n\nI need:\n\n- Check if x < 0 (using Math.LessThan with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y >= 0 (using Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Check if x >= 0 (Math.LessThanOrEqual with left: x, right: 0)\n\n- Check if y < 0 (Math.LessThan with left: y, right: 0)\n\n- Combine these with \"Logic.And\"\n\nThen, combine the two \"And\" results with \"Logic.Or\" to get the final output.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the case when either x or y is zero.\n\nIf x is zero and y is positive, then (x >= 0 && y < 0) is false, and (x < 0 && y >= 0) is false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if both are zero, both conditions are false, so overall false, which is correct.\n\nIf x is positive and y is negative, one condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nIf x is negative and y is positive, the other condition will be true, so overall true.\n\nSeems good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the multiplication approach:\n\nMultiply x and y, and check if the result is negative.\n\nBut this might have issues with overflow for large integers, although in Midio, numbers might be handled differently.\n\nAlso, multiplying two large numbers could be less efficient than simple comparisons.\n\nSo, stick with the comparison-based approach.\n\nNow, to implement this in Midio, I need to set up the instances accordingly.\n\nGiven the function signature:\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\nI need to create instances for:\n\n- Math.LessThan for x < 0\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for y >= 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nSimilarly for the other condition:\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual for x >= 0\n\n- Math.LessThan for y < 0\n\n- Logic.And to combine them\n\nThen, Logic.Or to combine the two And results.\n\nFinally, connect the output to the output property.\n\nI need to make sure that the connections are correct, i.e., the outputs of the conditions are connected to the Logic.And inputs, and the outputs of the Logic.And instances are connected to the Logic.Or inputs, and finally, the Logic.Or output is connected to the final output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the input properties x and y are connected to the respective Math functions.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out in code format.\n\nFirst, import the standard library:\n\nimport(\"std\", Std_k98ojb)\n\nThen, define the module:\n\nmodule() main {\n\nfunc(doc: \"checks whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.\") opposite_signs {\n\nin(x: -426, y: -248, name: \"x\") property(Number) x_853326\n\nin(x: -420, y: -107, name: \"y\") property(Number) y_5390f5\n\nout(x: 159, y: -219, name: \"output\") property(Bool) output_3339a3\n\n}\n\n}\n\nNow, inside the function, create the instances.\n\nInstance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: some_x, y: some_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, in Midio, instance connections are made via arrows, and properties are connected.\n\nSo, actually, I need to define instances and connect their inputs and outputs.\n\nLet's try.\n\nFirst, create an instance for x < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThan_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThan_x.right\n\nSimilarly, for y >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nWait, actually, for y >= 0, it's y >= 0, so left: y, right: 0\n\nThen, connect y_5390f5 to lessThanOrEqual_y.left\n\nAnd constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_y.right\n\nThen, create a Logic.And instance to combine these two:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) and1 root.Std_k98ojb.Logic.And {\n\nin1: lessThan_x.result\n\nin2: lessThanOrEqual_y.result\n\n}\n\nSimilarly, for the other condition:\n\nx >= 0 and y < 0\n\nSo, x >= 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThanOrEqual_x root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual {\n\nleft: x\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect x_853326 to lessThanOrEqual_x.left\n\nConnect constant 0 to lessThanOrEqual_x.right\n\nAnd y < 0:\n\ninstance(x: pos_x, y: pos_y) lessThan_y root.Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThan {\n\nleft: y\n\nright: 0\n\n}\n\nConnect y_5390f5 to less"

                "I'm trying to create a function in Midio that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11. The function should take an input number and output a boolean value indicating whether it's divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11, including zero.\n\nSo, for example, take the number 121:\n\n- Positions are counted from left to right, starting with position 1 as odd.\n\n- Digits: 1 (position 1, odd), 2 (position 2, even), 1 (position 3, odd).\n\n- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum of digits in even positions: 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example, number 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd), 4 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 7 (odd), 8 (even), 9 (odd)\n\n- Sum odd: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum even: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, the function needs to:\n\n1. Take an input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n\n3. Iterate through each digit, keeping track of whether its position is odd or even.\n\n4. Sum the digits in odd positions and even positions separately.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between these two sums.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\n7. Output true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI need to implement this logic using Midio nodes. I'll likely need nodes for string manipulation, math operations, loops, and conditionals.\n\nLet me think about the steps in more detail:\n\n- First, I need to convert the number to a string so I can iterate through each digit.\n\n- Then, I need to iterate through each character in the string, determining its position (odd or even).\n\n- For each digit, add it to the appropriate sum (odd or even).\n\n- After processing all digits, calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- Finally, check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers. The divisibility rule should work the same way regardless of the sign, so I can take the absolute value of the number before processing.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the input is zero. Zero is divisible by any non-zero number, including 11, so the function should return true for n=0.\n\nLet me outline the steps again, considering edge cases:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number to handle negatives.\n\n2. Convert the number to a string to access individual digits.\n\n3. Initialize two sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions.\n\n4. Iterate through each character in the string:\n\na. Determine the position (odd or even based on index).\n\nb. Convert the character to a number.\n\nc. Add to the appropriate sum based on position.\n\n5. Calculate the difference between the sums of odd and even positions.\n\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11:\n\na. If the difference modulo 11 is 0, then it's divisible.\n\n7. Output true if divisible, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in programming, the modulo operator can be used to check divisibility. If a number modulo 11 equals zero, then it's divisible by 11.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the difference is divisible by 11, which includes negative differences, but since I'm taking the absolute value earlier, all differences should be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the implementation in Midio:\n\n- I'll need a node to convert the number to a string.\n\n- A loop to iterate through each character in the string.\n\n- Conditionals to determine if the position is odd or even.\n\n- Math nodes to sum the digits accordingly.\n\n- A node to calculate the difference between the two sums.\n\n- A node to check if this difference is divisible by 11 using the modulo operation.\n\nI should also consider the efficiency, but since we're dealing with numbers that have a reasonable number of digits, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nLet me sketch a rough diagram of the nodes:\n\n- Start with the input number.\n\n- Connect to an \"absolute value\" math node.\n\n- Connect to a \"toString\" conversion node.\n\n- Connect to a \"split string\" node to get an array of characters.\n\n- Connect to a \"for each\" loop node.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get the index and character.\n\n- Determine if the index is odd or even.\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Add to odd sum or even sum based on position.\n\n- After the loop, subtract even sum from odd sum.\n\n- Take the absolute value of the difference.\n\n- Use modulo operator with 11.\n\n- Check if the result is 0.\n\n- Output true if yes, false otherwise.\n\nWait, but in the divisibility rule, we take the difference between sums of digits in odd and even positions, and check if that difference is divisible by 11. It's not necessary to take the absolute value of the difference because zero is considered divisible, and negative numbers are also considered divisible if their positive counterparts are.\n\nSo, in the modulo operation, both positive and negative differences that are multiples of 11 will yield zero.\n\nBut in programming, the modulo operator for negative numbers can behave differently depending on the language. In some languages, -11 modulo 11 is 0, but I need to confirm how Midio handles this.\n\nTo be safe, I can take the absolute value of the difference before applying the modulo operation.\n\nAlso, considering that the input can be a floating-point number, but for divisibility rules, we typically deal with integers. So, I should ensure that the input is an integer. If it's a float, I might need to truncate or round it to an integer.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"a number,\" not necessarily an integer. However, divisibility by 11 is generally defined for integers. So, I'll assume that the input is an integer.\n\nI should add a check to ensure that the input is an integer, and if not, perhaps round it to the nearest integer or return an error.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me also consider the case when the input is zero, as mentioned earlier. Zero should return true.\n\nAnother consideration is the sign of the number. Since divisibility is not affected by the sign, I can ignore the sign by taking the absolute value.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take the absolute value of the input number.\n\n2. Convert it to a string.\n\n3. Split the string into an array of characters.\n\n4. Initialize two variables: sumOdd and sumEven to zero.\n\n5. Iterate through the array with indices:\n\na. For each character, convert it back to a number.\n\nb. If the index is odd, add to sumOdd; if even, add to sumEven.\n\n6. Calculate difference = sumOdd - sumEven.\n\n7. Compute abs(difference) % 11.\n\n8. If the result is zero, output true; else, false.\n\nWait, but in programming, array indices usually start at 0, which is even. But in our position count, we considered position 1 as odd.\n\nSo, to match positions:\n\n- Index 0 in the array corresponds to position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 corresponds to position 2 (even).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, in the loop:\n\n- For each character at index i:\n\n- If i is even (0, 2, 4,...), it's in an odd position.\n\n- If i is odd (1, 3, 5,...), it's in an even position.\n\nWait, no. Wait a minute.\n\nIn programming, array indices start at 0.\n\nBut positions in the number start at 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Character at index 0 is position 1 (odd).\n\n- Index 1 is position 2 (even).\n\n- Index 2 is position 3 (odd).\n\n- And so on.\n\nTherefore, to determine if a position is odd or even:\n\n- If the index is even, position is odd.\n\n- If the index is odd, position is even.\n\nSo, in the loop:\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, it's an odd position.\n\n- Else, even position.\n\nWait, but in programming terms:\n\n- Index 0 (even index) corresponds to odd position.\n\n- Index 1 (odd index) corresponds to even position.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the loop, I need to check if the index is even or odd to determine the position.\n\nNow, in Midio, how do I iterate through a string with indices?\n\nI think there's a way to get both the index and the value in a loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can convert the string to an array of characters and iterate through it with indices.\n\nAssuming Midio has a \"for each with index\" loop, I can use that"

For example, if the list is [2, 3, 3, 4], the unique numbers are 2, 3, and 4, and their product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nIn Midio, I need to design a flow that accomplishes this. I'll need to:\n\n1. Take the input list.\n\n2. Remove duplicates to get unique numbers.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n4. Output the result.\n\nLet's think about how to implement each step.\n\n**Step 1: Take the input list.**\n\nI have an input property called \"list\" of type List, which I assume contains numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Remove duplicates to get unique numbers.**\n\nTo remove duplicates from a list, I can use a set, since sets automatically handle uniqueness. However, in Midio, I need to see what functions are available for lists and sets.\n\nLooking at the external functions provided, I see \"Sets.Difference\" and \"Sets.Intersection\", but nothing that directly creates a set from a list or removes duplicates. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the \"List.Contains\" function in combination with some looping mechanism to build a new list of unique numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to iterate through the list and collect only unique items.\n\nLet me think about using the \"Iteration.Filter\" function. I can filter the list by checking if an item has already been included in the result list.\n\nTo do this, I would need to keep track of items that have already been seen. Maybe using another list to store seen items.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n- Initialize an empty list to store unique numbers.\n\n- Iterate through the input list.\n\n- For each number, check if it's already in the unique list.\n\n- If not, add it to the unique list.\n\n- Once all items are processed, proceed to calculate the product.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's a node-based system, I need to represent this logic using nodes and their connections.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the product of these unique numbers.**\n\nOnce I have the unique list, I can use the \"Iteration.Reduce\" function to multiply all the numbers together.\n\nThe reduce function can apply a binary operation cumulatively to the items of the list, so I can use it to multiply them.\n\nI need to set the initial value of the accumulator to 1, since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.\n\n**Step 4: Output the result.**\n\nFinally, I need to output the result through the \"output\" property.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to create a function named \"unique_product\" with the specified inputs and outputs.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to:\n\n- Have an input trigger \"execute\" to start the process.\n\n- Take the \"list\" input property.\n\n- Process the list to get unique numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n- Set the \"output\" property with the result.\n\n- Trigger the \"continue\" output when done.\n\nI need to ensure that the flow is correctly connected so that operations happen in the right order.\n\nLet me sketch a rough outline of the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. A starting trigger node (\"execute\").\n\n2. A node to generate unique numbers from the list.\n\n3. A node to calculate the product of these unique numbers.\n\n4. A node to set the \"output\" property with the result.\n\n5. A node to trigger \"continue\" when everything is done.\n\nBut since Midio is a visual programming environment, I need to represent this logic using nodes and their connections.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter unique numbers.\n\nWait, but filter typically excludes items based on a condition, whereas I want to include only unique items.\n\nMaybe I need to use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can sort the list and then remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nBut looking at the provided functions, I see \"List.Sort\" which can sort the list.\n\nAfter sorting, identical numbers will be adjacent, and then I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" to remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nSo, the plan could be:\n\n- Sort the input list.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to keep only the items that are not equal to the previous item.\n\n- Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to multiply all the items in this filtered list.\n\n- Set the output property with the result.\n\n- Trigger \"continue\".\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet's think about the details.\n\nFirst, I need to sort the list. I can use the \"List.Sort\" function.\n\nThen, I need to filter out consecutive duplicates.\n\nFor that, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a predicate that checks if the current item is equal to the previous item.\n\nHowever, in Midio, functions might not have direct access to previous items, so I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each item is paired with the previous item, and then filter based on whether they are equal.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAnother idea: Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a list of unique items.\n\nIn the reduce function, I can accumulate a list, and only add the current item if it's not already in the accumulated list.\n\nThen, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to calculate the product of this unique list.\n\nThis seems possible.\n\nSo, in more detail:\n\n- Use \"List.Empty\" to create an empty list.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with the input list and the initial accumulator set to the empty list.\n\n- In the reducer function, check if the current item is in the accumulated list.\n\n- If not, add it to the accumulated list.\n\n- Finally, after reduction, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to multiply all items in the unique list, starting with 1.\n\n- Set the output property with the product.\n\n- Trigger \"continue\".\n\nBut I need to make sure that the reducer function can handle adding items to a list and checking for existence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, maybe I can use \"Sets.Difference\" to get unique items.\n\nBut \"Sets.Difference\" is for getting elements in one set minus another.\n\nHmm.\n\nActually, to get unique items, I might need to implement a custom function.\n\nGiven the constraints of Midio's provided functions, it seems a bit tricky, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, create the sorted list using \"List.Sort\".\n\nThen, use \"Iteration.Filter\" to remove consecutive duplicates.\n\nFor the filter predicate, I need to have access to the previous item.\n\nI'm not sure if Midio's \"Iteration.Filter\" provides the previous item.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Map\" to pair each item with its index and then filter based on whether the current item is equal to the next one.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use \"List.Contains\" within the filter predicate.\n\nSo, for each item, check if it's already in the accumulated list of unique items.\n\nBut for that, I need to maintain the accumulated list somehow.\n\nIn Midio, since it's a node-based system, maintaining state across iterations is challenging.\n\nMaybe I need to use a counter or some looping mechanism.\n\nWait, perhaps using \"Std.For\" loop can help.\n\n\"Std.For\" allows iteration over a list.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over the sorted list.\n\n- For each item, check if it's already in the unique list.\n\n- If not, add it to the unique list.\n\n- After the loop, calculate the product.\n\nBut I need to manage the unique list across iterations, which might require using instance variables or some form of accumulator.\n\nI need to see how \"Std.For\" handles accumulators.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a list accumulator.\n\nLet me look for a \"List.Contains\" function to check if an item is already in the accumulator list.\n\nAssuming I can use \"List.Contains\", I can create a reducer that adds the current item to the accumulator only if it's not already present.\n\nThen, after reduction, I'll have a list of unique items.\n\nFinally, use another \"Iteration.Reduce\" to calculate the product.\n\nThis seems workable.\n\nSo, in code terms, it would look like:\n\nunique_list = reduce(list, [], func(accumulator, item):\n\n    if not List.Contains(accumulator, item):\n\n        return append(accumulator, item)\n\n    else:\n\n        return accumulator\n\n)\n\nproduct = reduce(unique_list, 1, func(acc, item): acc * item)\n\noutput = product\n\ncontinue()\n\nNow, I need to translate this logic into Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to create instances for \"List.Sort\", \"Iteration.Reduce\" for uniqueness, another \"Iteration.Reduce\" for product, and set the output property.\n\nAlso, ensure that the flow is triggered correctly from \"execute\" to \"continue\".\n\nGiven the complexity, I might need to break it down into smaller functions, but since the task is to create a single function, I need to manage it within the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way that I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the \"Sets\" functions"

                "I need to create a Midio function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. The function should take two inputs: a list and a number indicating how many positions to rotate the list to the right. The output should be the rotated list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to rotate a list to the right by n positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last n elements are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the effective rotation number by taking n modulo the length of the list, since rotating by the length of the list would result in the same list.\n\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the remaining elements.\n\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI need to handle cases where n is larger than the list length, negative, or zero. Using the modulo operation will help handle cases where n is larger than the list length. If n is zero, the list remains unchanged. If n is negative, it would typically mean rotating to the left, but since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume n is non-negative.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to use the available external functions to manipulate lists and perform necessary operations.\n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n- Calculate the effective rotation number: rotation = n % list_length\n\n- If rotation is zero, output the original list\n\n- Otherwise, split the list into two parts:\n\n- Part1: last 'rotation' elements\n\n- Part2: the remaining elements from the start to list_length - rotation\n\n- Concatenate part1 and part2 to get the rotated list\n\nI need to find Midio functions that can help me with these operations.\n\nLooking at the provided external functions, I see:\n\n- List.Length: to get the length of the list\n\n- List.Slice: to get a slice of the list from start to end indices\n\n- List.Concat: to concatenate two lists\n\n- Math.Modulo: to calculate n modulo list_length\n\nSo, I can use List.Length to get the list length, Math.Modulo to calculate the effective rotation, and List.Slice to get the two parts of the list. Then, use List.Concat to combine them.\n\nLet me think about how to use List.Slice. List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nTo get the last 'rotation' elements, I can slice from list_length - rotation to list_length.\n\nTo get the remaining elements, I can slice from 0 to list_length - rotation.\n\nThen, concatenate the two slices in reverse order: part1 (last rotation elements) + part2 (remaining elements).\n\nI need to handle the case where rotation is zero by directly outputting the original list.\n\nAlso, need to handle empty lists or n=0 scenarios.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio nodes.\n\nFirst, get the list length using List.Length.\n\nThen, calculate effective rotation: rotation = n % list_length\n\nIf rotation is zero, output the original list.\n\nElse, proceed to slice and concatenate.\n\nTo implement the condition, I can use Std.If or Logic.Equal for checking if rotation is zero.\n\nAssuming I use Std.If, I can have:\n\n- Condition: rotation == 0\n\n- If true: output the original list\n\n- If false: perform the slicing and concatenation\n\nSo, I need to create nodes for:\n\n1. List.Length to get list_length\n\n2. Math.Modulo to compute rotation = n % list_length\n\n3. Std.If to check if rotation == 0\n\n4. If true: output the original list\n\n5. If false:\n\na. Calculate start_index_for_part1 = list_length - rotation\n\nb. Use List.Slice to get part1 from start_index_for_part1 to list_length\n\nc. Use List.Slice to get part2 from 0 to start_index_for_part1\n\nd. Use List.Concat to concatenate part1 and part2\n\ne. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly calculated and handled.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where list_length is zero, but in such cases, rotating by any n would result in the same empty list.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=2\n\nlist_length = 5\n\nrotation = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nstart_index_for_part1 = 5 - 2 = 3\n\npart1 = slice from 3 to 5 -> [4, 5]\n\npart2 = slice from 0 to 3 -> [1, 2, 3]\n\nconcatenated = [4, 5] + [1, 2, 3] -> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=5\n\nrotation = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nSo, output the original list.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n=7\n\nrotation = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nSame as first example, output [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nList: [1, 2, 3], n=1\n\nrotation = 1 % 3 = 1\n\nstart_index_for_part1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\npart1 = slice from 2 to 3 -> [3]\n\npart2 = slice from 0 to 2 -> [1, 2]\n\nconcatenated = [3] + [1, 2] -> [3, 1, 2]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2], n=0\n\nrotation = 0 % 2 = 0\n\nOutput original list [1, 2]\n\nList: [], n=0\n\nrotation = 0 % 0 = NaN? Need to handle division by zero.\n\nActually, in programming, modulo operation with zero should return the number itself or throw an error. In Midio, I need to see how Math.Modulo handles n % 0.\n\nAssuming it returns n or throws an error, I need to handle this case to output the original list, which is empty.\n\nTo make the function robust, I should consider that if the list is empty, regardless of n, the output should be the empty list.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nif list_length == 0:\n\noutput = []\n\nelse:\n\nrotation = n % list_length\n\nif rotation == 0:\n\noutput = original_list\n\nelse:\n\nstart_index = list_length - rotation\n\npart1 = list[start_index : list_length]\n\npart2 = list[0 : start_index]\n\noutput = part1 + part2\n\nIn Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available functions.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need to create instances for:\n\n- List.Length to get list_length\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute rotation = n % list_length\n\n- Std.If to check if rotation == 0\n\n- List.Slice to get part1 and part2\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate part1 and part2\n\nAlso, need to calculate start_index = list_length - rotation\n\nFor that, I can use Math.Subtract: start_index = list_length - rotation\n\nSo, add Math.Subtract for this calculation.\n\nNow, let's think about the data flow:\n\n1. list -> List.Length -> list_length\n\n2. n and list_length -> Math.Modulo -> rotation\n\n3. rotation and 0 -> Logic.Equal -> condition\n\n4. Std.If:\n\n- If true (rotation == 0): output = original_list\n\n- If false:\n\na. list_length and rotation -> Math.Subtract -> start_index\n\nb. list and start_index and list_length -> List.Slice -> part1\n\nc. list and 0 and start_index -> List.Slice -> part2\n\nd. part1 and part2 -> List.Concat -> output\n\n5. Std.If.output -> output_823209\n\nI need to make sure that the List.Slice nodes receive the correct start and end indices.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice probably takes list, start, and end as inputs.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where start_index is negative, but since rotation is n % list_length, and list_length is positive, start_index should always be non-negative.\n\nWait, if list_length is 5 and rotation is 2, start_index is 3. If list_length is 3 and rotation is 2, start_index is 1. So, no negative indices.\n\nAlso, need to ensure that start_index is less than or equal to list_length.\n\nNow, let's consider implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to define a function with inputs list and n, and output output.\n\nI'll need to create instances for the required functions and connect them appropriately.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the nodes and connections:\n\n- List.Length instance:\n\ninput: list\n\noutput: list_length\n\n- Math.Modulo instance:\n\ninputs: n, list_length\n\noutput: rotation\n\n- Logic.Equal instance:\n\ninputs: rotation, 0\n\noutput: condition\n\n- Std.If instance:\n\ncondition: condition\n\nif true:\n\noutput: original_list\n\nif false:\n\n- Math.Subtract instance:\n\ninputs"

The function should take an integer as input and return a boolean indicating whether it's prime or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, to check if a number is prime, I need to verify that it's greater than 1 and that it's only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\nIn Midio, I'll need to set up a function with an input for the number to check and an output for the result. I might also need some control flow nodes to perform the checks.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Check if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it's not prime.\n\n2. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any of these divisions have no remainder, then it's not prime.\n\n3. If none of the divisions have a remainder, then it's prime.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio. I'll need nodes for comparison, looping, and possibly mathematical operations like division and square roots.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see nodes like Std.If, Math.Expression, Iteration.Map, List.GenerateRange, etc. I think I can use List.GenerateRange to generate a list of potential divisors and then check if any of them divide the number evenly.\n\nHere's a rough plan:\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange to create a list of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number (inclusive).\n\n- Use Iteration.Map to check for each divisor in the list whether it divides the input number without a remainder.\n\n- If any divisor divides the number without a remainder, the number is not prime.\n\n- If no such divisor is found, the number is prime.\n\nI need to handle the case where the input number is less than or equal to 1 separately, as those are not prime by definition.\n\nAlso, I need to calculate the square root of the input number.

                "Sorry, I made a mistake in the previous response. Let's try again.\n\nSo, the task is to create a function that checks whether a given number is a perfect square. The function should take an input number and return a boolean indicating whether it is a perfect square or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfect square is. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it's 4 squared, but 14 isn't because there's no integer that, when squared, equals 14.\n\nTo check if a number is a perfect square, one common approach is to iterate through numbers starting from 1, square them, and see if any of these squares equal the input number. If we find such a number, then the input is a perfect square; otherwise, it's not.\n\nIn Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available nodes. I'll likely need to use loops, conditionals, and mathematical operations.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n\n2. Start with a counter, say 1.\n\n3. Square the counter.\n\n4. Check if the square is equal to the input number.\n\n- If yes, it's a perfect square.\n\n- If not, check if the square is greater than the input number.\n\n- If yes, it's not a perfect square.\n\n- If not, increment the counter and repeat from step 3.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward approach. Now, I need to translate this into Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A loop node to iterate through possible square roots.\n\n- A squaring operation.\n\n- Comparison nodes to check equality and greater than conditions.\n\n- Conditional nodes to decide whether to continue the loop or stop.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases, like negative numbers (which aren't perfect squares) and zero.\n\nLet me sketch a rough flow:\n\n- Check if the input is negative; if so, immediately return false.\n\n- If the input is zero, return true, since 0 is a perfect square (0^2 = 0).\n\n- For positive numbers, proceed with the loop.\n\nWait, in the signature provided, there's an input named \"input\" of type Number, and outputs \"out\" of type Bool and \"continue\" of type Trigger. But in the task description, it mentions checking if a number is a perfect square, so I assume \"input\" is the number to check, and \"out\" is the result.\n\nHowever, in the signature, there's also an \"execute\" trigger and a \"continue\" trigger. This suggests that the function is asynchronous and needs to be triggered to start execution.\n\nGiven that, I need to set up the function so that when \"execute\" is triggered, it starts the process of checking if \"input\" is a perfect square and eventually sets \"out\" to the result and triggers \"continue\" when done.\n\nIn Midio, loops can be implemented using the \"For\" node, which iterates over a list of items. So, I need to generate a list of potential square roots to check.\n\nOne way is to generate a list from 1 to the input number and square each one, then check if any square equals the input.\n\nBut that might be inefficient for large numbers. Alternatively, I can generate a range up to the square root of the input number, but I'm not sure if Midio has a square root function.\n\nLet me see what mathematical operations are available in the \"Std\" module.\n\nAssuming I have access to basic arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc., but maybe not square root.\n\nSo, generating a range from 1 to the input number and squaring each one seems feasible, though potentially slow for large inputs.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a \"For\" loop to iterate through numbers starting from 1, square them, and check if the square equals the input or exceeds it.\n\nI think the second approach is better because I can stop the loop as soon as the square exceeds the input, which is more efficient.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- When \"execute\" is triggered, start the \"For\" loop.\n\n- In the \"For\" loop, iterate through numbers starting from 1.\n\n- For each number, square it.\n\n- Check if the square equals the input:\n\n- If yes, set \"out\" to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If the square exceeds the input:\n\n- Set \"out\" to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If not, continue to the next iteration.\n\nI need to make sure that the loop stops either when a perfect square is found or when it's determined that no such square exists.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the input is zero or negative.\n\nWait, in the signature, there's no input for checking if the number is negative or zero. Maybe I need to handle those cases inside the function.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- Have an initial check if the input is less than 1 (i.e., zero or negative). If so, set \"out\" to false (since they are not perfect squares except for zero).\n\n- If the input is zero, set \"out\" to true.\n\n- For positive integers, proceed with the loop.\n\nBut in the signature, there's only one input \"input\" of type Number, and outputs \"out\" of type Bool and \"continue\" of type Trigger.\n\nI need to make sure that the function sets \"out\" appropriately and triggers \"continue\" when done.\n\nAlso, considering that Midio might have specific nodes for handling numbers and conditions, I need to use those accordingly.\n\nLet me try to outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. A \"For\" node to iterate through potential square roots.\n\n2. A \"Math.Mul\" node to square the current iterator value.\n\n3. A \"Std.If\" node to check if the square equals the input.\n\n4. Another \"Std.If\" node to check if the square exceeds the input.\n\n5. \"Logic.And\" or other logic nodes as needed for combining conditions.\n\n6. Connections to set \"out\" and trigger \"continue\" based on the results.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"For\" loop can be triggered by the \"execute\" input and that it iterates over a suitable range.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function doesn't run indefinitely for large numbers, so I need to set an appropriate stopping condition.\n\nGiven that, perhaps generating a range up to the input number divided by 2 could be a\u4f18\u5316, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since squaring numbers grows quickly, iterating until the square is less than or equal to the input should suffice.\n\nWait, actually, for checking perfect squares, I need to iterate until the square of the iterator is less than or equal to the input.\n\nIf the square equals the input, it's a perfect square; if it exceeds, it's not.\n\nSo, in the \"For\" loop, I can generate a list of numbers starting from 1 up to the point where their square is less than or equal to the input.\n\nBut in Midio, the \"List.GenerateRange\" node generates a list from a start value to an end value.\n\nHowever, the end value is inclusive, so I need to ensure that the range doesn't go beyond necessary.\n\nWait, but in practice, for large numbers, generating a large list might not be efficient.\n\nMaybe there's a better way to handle this in Midio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a \"While\" loop construct, but checking if Midio has a \"While\" loop node.\n\nLooking back, the \"For\" node in Midio is used for iterating over a list, but it doesn't have a traditional while loop.\n\nSo, I need to generate a list of numbers to check.\n\nGiven that, perhaps generating a list from 1 to the input number is acceptable, as the input for perfect square checks is likely to be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can optimize by generating numbers up to the input divided by 2, but even that might not be necessary.\n\nLet me consider that for small inputs, say up to 1000, generating a list up to 1000 isn't a problem.\n\nFor larger inputs, say up to 1e6, generating a list of 1e6 elements might be too memory-intensive.\n\nBut in practice, for such large inputs, there are better mathematical ways to check for perfect squares, like using square root functions and checking if the square root is an integer.\n\nHowever, if Midio doesn't have a square root function, I need to implement this manually.\n\nAssuming that square root functionality isn't available, I'll proceed with the iterative approach.\n\nSo, here's what I'll do:\n\n- Use \"List.GenerateRange\" to create a list of numbers from 1 to the input number.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Map\" to square each number in the list.\n\n- Iterate through the squared numbers and check if any match the input.\n\n- If a match is found, set \"out\" to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If no match is found and the square exceeds the input, set \"out\" to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\nWait, but this approach involves generating the entire list of squares first, which might not be efficient for large inputs.\n\nAn alternative is to iterate through numbers starting from 1, square them on the fly, and check against the input, stopping when the square exceeds the input.\n\nBut since Midio's \"For\" node works on a list, I need to generate a list up front.\n\nPerhaps there's no way around generating the list.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a single \"For\" node and compute the square inside the loop.\n\nLet me check the \"For"

                "I need to create a Midio function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. The function should take two inputs: a list and a number indicating how many positions to rotate the list to the right. The output should be the rotated list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to rotate a list to the right by n positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last n elements are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the effective rotation number by taking n modulo the length of the list, since rotating by the length of the list would result in the same list.\n\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the preceding elements.\n\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI need to handle cases where n is larger than the list length, negative, or zero. Using the modulo operation will help handle cases where n is larger than the list length. For negative n, rotating to the right by a negative number is equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value of n.\n\nHowever, since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume n is non-negative. If n can be negative, I need to handle left rotations as well, but for now, I'll focus on positive n.\n\nLet's consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 2\n\nEffective rotation: 2\n\nSplit the list into [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5]\n\nConcatenate as [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 0\n\nEffective rotation: 0\n\nNo change, list remains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 5\n\nEffective rotation: 0 (since 5 mod 5 = 0)\n\nList remains the same.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available nodes.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- To calculate the effective rotation: n modulo list length.\n\n- To split the list into two parts at the specified rotation point.\n\n- To concatenate these parts in reverse order.\n\nPotential nodes to use:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute n mod list length.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nSteps in Midio:\n\n1. Get the length of the list using List.Length.\n\n2. Compute effective rotation: n mod list length using Math.Modulo.\n\n3. If effective rotation is 0, output the original list.\n\n4. Otherwise, split the list into two parts:\n\n- First part: from index 0 to list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Second part: from list length - effective rotation to the end.\n\n5. Concatenate the second part and the first part.\n\nI need to handle cases where the list is empty or n is 0.\n\nIf the list is empty, rotating it any number of times should return an empty list.\n\nIf n is 0, the list remains unchanged.\n\nAlso, if n is equal to the list length, it's equivalent to no rotation.\n\nI should ensure that the function doesn't modify the original list but creates a new rotated list.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the function with inputs for list and n, and output for the rotated list.\n\nThen, I'll add a node to get the length of the list.\n\nNext, compute effective rotation: n mod list length.\n\nThen, use List.Slice to get the two parts:\n\n- First part: slice from 0 to list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Second part: slice from list length - effective rotation to the end.\n\nFinally, concatenate the second part and the first part.\n\nI need to connect these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case when the effective rotation is 0 by directly outputting the original list.\n\nTo do this, I can use a conditional statement: if effective rotation == 0, output the original list; else, perform the rotation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use Std.If for conditional execution.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate effective rotation: n mod list length.\n\n2. Use Std.If to check if effective rotation == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to rotate the list.\n\n3. If rotating:\n\na. Slice the list into two parts.\n\nb. Concatenate them in reverse order.\n\nc. Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that all operations are connected correctly and that the data flows properly.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n- List.Length to get the list length.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute n mod list length.\n\n- Std.If to handle the condition when effective rotation is 0.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nI need to connect:\n\n- list -> List.Length -> modulo -> Std.If condition.\n\n- n -> modulo.\n\n- Std.If true branch: output the original list.\n\n- Std.If false branch: perform slicing and concatenation, then output the result.\n\nAlso, in the false branch:\n\n- Calculate the split index: list length - effective rotation.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get the first part: from 0 to split index.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get the second part: from split index to the end.\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate second part and first part.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to ensure that the indices are correctly calculated for slicing.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices.\n\nStart is inclusive, end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for the first part: start=0, end=split index.\n\nFor the second part: start=split index, end=list length.\n\nThen, concatenate second part + first part.\n\nLet me consider an example in Midio:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 2\n\nList.Length: 5\n\neffective rotation: 2 mod 5 = 2\n\nsplit index: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nfirst part: slice 0 to 3 -> [1, 2, 3]\n\nsecond part: slice 3 to 5 -> [4, 5]\n\nconcatenate second part + first part: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 0\n\neffective rotation: 0 mod 5 = 0\n\noutput original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 5\n\neffective rotation: 5 mod 5 = 0\n\noutput original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nn: 3\n\neffective rotation: 3 mod 5 = 3\n\nsplit index: 5 - 3 = 2\n\nfirst part: slice 0 to 2 -> [1, 2]\n\nsecond part: slice 2 to 5 -> [3, 4, 5]\n\nconcatenate second part + first part: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]\n\nCorrect.\n\nList: []\n\nn: 2\n\neffective rotation: 2 mod 0 = undefined?\n\nWait, modulo by zero is undefined.\n\nIn practice, list length is zero, so effective rotation should be zero.\n\nBut in programming, modulo by zero might return zero or raise an error.\n\nIn Midio, I need to handle the case when list length is zero.\n\nI should check if list length is zero, and if so, output an empty list without rotating.\n\nSo, modify the condition:\n\nIf list length == 0 or effective rotation == 0, output the original list.\n\nElse, perform the rotation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use another Std.If to handle this.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps in Midio, n mod 0 returns 0, so effective rotation would be zero, which is correct.\n\nI need to verify how Math.Modulo handles division by zero.\n\nAssuming Math.Modulo(n, 0) returns 0, then effective rotation would be zero, and the function would correctly output the original list.\n\nIf Math.Modulo(n, 0) raises an error, I need to handle that case separately.\n\nTo be safe, I'll assume Math.Modulo handles division by zero gracefully, returning 0.\n\nOtherwise, I might need to add an extra condition to check if list length is zero.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with the assumption that Math.Modulo(n, 0) = 0.\n\nSo, my function will be:\n\nfunc rotate_right(list: List, n: Number) -> List {\n\n    length = List.Length(list)\n\n    effective_rotation = Math.Modulo(n, length)\n\n    if effective_rotation == 0 {\n\n        return list\n\n    } else {\n\n        split_index = length - effective_rotation"

                "I've been working on this problem of checking whether a given integer is a prime number. It's a classic problem in programming, and I want to make sure I approach it correctly using Midio.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, to check if a number is prime, I need to verify that it's not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n\nIn Midio, I'll need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether it's prime or not. I also need to handle the execution trigger and output the result.\n\nI think I can start by checking if the number is less than 2, in which case it's not prime. Then, I can iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number and check if any of these numbers divide the input number evenly. If I find any such divisor, the number is not prime.\n\nI recall that iterating up to the square root of the number is sufficient because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, it must also have a factor smaller than its square root.\n\nSo, in Midio, I'll need to set up a loop that goes from 2 to the square root of the input number. For each iterator, I'll check if the input number is divisible by it. If it is, then the number is not prime.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the input number is 2, which is prime, and other edge cases like negative numbers or non-integer inputs, but for simplicity, I'll assume the input is a positive integer greater than 1.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps:\n\n1. Check if the number is less than 2. If so, it's not prime.\n\n2. If the number is 2, it's prime.\n\n3. For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n\n4. If any divisor is found, it's not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic using the available nodes.\n\nI see there's a \"Std.For\" node that can be used for looping. I'll need to generate a list of numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number. To get the square root, I might need to use a mathematical expression node.\n\nWait, I look through the list of external functions, and I see \"Math.Sqrt\" is not directly listed. Maybe I can use \"Math.Pow\" to calculate the square root by raising to the power of 0.5.\n\nSo, to get the square root of a number, I can use Math.Pow(input, 0.5).\n\nThen, I need to generate a list of numbers from 2 up to that square root value. Since the list needs to be integers, I might need to floor the square root value.\n\nI can use \"Math.Floor\" to get the largest integer less than or equal to the square root.\n\nWait, scanning the list again, I don't see \"Math.Floor\" either. Maybe I need to find another way to get an integer value for the upper limit of my loop.\n\nAlternatively, I can generate a range from 2 to the square root and then map it to integers, but this might complicate things.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a for loop that starts at 2 and increments by 1 until some condition is met.\n\nWait, looking back at the \"Std.For\" node, it seems to iterate over a list of items. So, I need to generate a list of potential divisors.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.GenerateRange\" from 2 to the square root (inclusive), and then iterate over this list.\n\nBut again, I need to ensure that the upper limit is an integer.\n\nMaybe I can calculate the square root using Math.Pow and then cast it to an integer by truncating the decimal part.\n\nIn Midio, is there a way to cast a number to integer? Or perhaps I can use \"Math.Floor\" somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the \"Math.Floor\" function if it's available, or maybe implement it using other mathematical operations.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with integers, I can increment a counter in the loop and check if its square is less than or equal to the input number.\n\nWait, that might be a better approach. I can iterate a variable \"i\" from 2 while \"i*i\" is less than or equal to the input number.\n\nIn each iteration, check if the input number is divisible by \"i\". If it is, return false immediately. If no such \"i\" is found, then the number is prime.\n\nThis way, I don't need to generate a list upfront, which might be more efficient.\n\nBut in Midio, since \"Std.For\" seems to work with lists, I might still need to generate a list for iteration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use recursion or some other control structure to implement this logic.\n\nWait, perhaps using a loop with conditions can simulate this behavior.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll need to calculate the square root of the input number and determine the upper limit for checking divisors.\n\nThen, generate a list of potential divisors from 2 up to that upper limit.\n\nThen, iterate over each divisor and check if the input number is divisible by it.\n\nIf any divisor divides the number evenly (i.e., remainder is 0), then the number is not prime.\n\nIf no such divisor is found, then the number is prime.\n\nIn Midio, I can set up a \"Std.For\" loop to iterate over the list of divisors and check the divisibility condition.\n\nI'll need to connect the loop's \"onItem\" event to a condition that checks if the input number is divisible by the current iterator.\n\nIf the condition is true, set the output to false and break out of the loop.\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any such divisor, set the output to true.\n\nI also need to handle the case where the input number is less than 2, in which case it's not prime.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider that the input could be a floating-point number, but since the function signature specifies \"Number\", which likely includes floats, I might need to ensure that only integer values are considered.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll assume that the input is always an integer.\n\nLet me start drafting the connections in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll have the \"execute\" trigger connected to a control node that checks if the input number is less than 2. If it is, set the output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\nIf the number is 2, set the output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\nFor numbers greater than 2, proceed to generate the list of potential divisors.\n\nTo generate the list, calculate the square root of the input number using Math.Pow(input, 0.5), then floor it to get the upper limit.\n\nThen, use \"List.GenerateRange\" from 2 to that upper limit.\n\nConnect the generated list to \"Std.For\" loop.\n\nIn the loop's \"onItem\" event, check if the input number modulo the current iterator equals zero.\n\nIf it does, set the output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\nIf the loop completes without finding any such divisor, set the output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\nI need to make sure that the loop can break early once a divisor is found to optimize performance.\n\nIn Midio, does \"Std.For\" allow breaking out of the loop prematurely?\n\nIf not, I might need to manage the loop logic differently, perhaps using a while loop or some other control structure.\n\nAlternatively, I can set a flag when a divisor is found and use that flag to decide the output.\n\nSo, perhaps have a boolean variable initialized to true (assuming the number is prime), and set it to false if any divisor is found.\n\nThen, after the loop completes, set the output based on the value of this flag.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a \"Property\" node to hold this flag state.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\n1. Check if input < 2 -> output = false\n\n2. Check if input = 2 -> output = true\n\n3. For input > 2:\n\na. Calculate upper limit as floor(sqrt(input))\n\nb. Generate list from 2 to upper limit\n\nc. Iterate over the list:\n\ni. If input % iterator == 0, set isPrime = false\n\nd. After iteration, output = isPrime\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio's node-based programming model.\n\nI should also consider optimizing the loop by checking divisors only up to the square root, as discussed earlier.\n\nAdditionally, I can skip even numbers after checking 2, but that might complicate things, so I'll keep it simple for now.\n\nLet me try to visualize this in Midio:\n\n- Execute trigger connects to a conditional node that checks if input < 2.\n\n- If true, set output to false and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If false, proceed to another conditional node that checks if input == 2.\n\n- If true, set output to true and trigger \"continue\".\n\n- If false, proceed to generate the list of divisors.\n\n- Use Math.Pow to calculate sqrt(input), then floor it (need to figure out how).\n\n- Use List.GenerateRange from 2 to floor(sqrt(input)).\n\n- Connect this list to Std.For loop.\n\n- In the loop's onItem event, check if input % iterator == 0.\n\n- If true, set isPrime = false.\n\n- After loop completes, set output based on isPrime.\n\nI"
