                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, if I have two lists, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. I think it refers to the symmetric difference between the two lists. That is, elements that are in one list but not in the other, and vice versa.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations because sets have built-in methods to find differences. However, since lists can contain duplicate elements and sets do not, I need to consider whether duplicates should be preserved or not.\n\nAssuming that duplicates are allowed in the lists and should be considered, I might need to approach this differently. But for simplicity, let's first consider the elements without worrying about duplicates, treating them as sets.\n\nSo, I can convert both lists to sets and then find the symmetric difference between these sets. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nIn Midio, I need to find the nodes that can help me achieve this. Looking at the list of external functions provided, I see \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, meaning elements in the first list that are not in the second.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I need to find elements that are in the first list but not in the second, and elements that are in the second list but not in the first, and then combine these two results.\n\nSo, I can use \"Sets.Difference\" twice: once for A minus B, and once for B minus A, and then concatenate the results.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create a function that takes two lists as input and outputs the symmetric difference.\n\nI should also consider the order of elements in the output. Since sets don't preserve order, if the order is important, I might need to handle it differently.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that the order is not important, and we can treat the lists as sets.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Convert both input lists to sets to remove duplicates and easily perform set operations.\n\n2. Use \"Sets.Difference\" to find elements in the first set that are not in the second set.\n\n3. Use \"Sets.Difference\" again to find elements in the second set that are not in the first set.\n\n4. Combine these two difference sets using \"List.Concat\" to get the symmetric difference.\n\n5. Output the resulting list.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the function handles empty lists gracefully and that it doesn't lose any elements that might be duplicates in the original lists if duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait a minute, the task says \"dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\" If duplicates are present, perhaps they should be considered. For example, if list A has [1, 2, 2, 3] and list B has [2, 3, 4], the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], considering the counts.\n\nBut treating them as sets, the symmetric difference would be [1, 2, 4], which matches this case. But in sets, '2' appears only once, whereas in lists, duplicates are possible.\n\nIf duplicates need to be preserved, I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should iterate through both lists and collect elements that are not present in the other list, considering duplicates.\n\nThis might be more complex. Let's consider this step by step.\n\nFirst, for list A, find elements that are not in list B, preserving duplicates.\n\nThen, for list B, find elements not in list A, preserving duplicates.\n\nFinally, combine these two results.\n\nIn Midio, I can use list filtering or some form of iteration to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there's \"List.Filter\" which can be used to filter elements based on a condition.\n\nSo, for list A, filter elements that are not in list B.\n\nSimilarly, for list B, filter elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate these two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nI'll need to create two filter operations: one for each list, filtering out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function can handle lists of different types, but in Midio, I believe types are inferred or specified, so I need to make sure the function is typed correctly.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider edge cases, such as one list being empty or both lists being empty.\n\nLet's consider an example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [2, 3, 4]\n\nDissimilar elements should be [1, 2, 4], since '2' appears in both but with one less in B, so one '2' is dissimilar.\n\nWait, if duplicates are considered, it's a bit tricky.\n\nActually, in terms of list differences considering duplicates, it's similar to finding elements in A that don't have counterparts in B and vice versa, considering the counts.\n\nThis is akin to finding the symmetric difference in multiset theory.\n\nIn multisets, the difference accounts for the count of elements.\n\nBut in Midio, I'm not sure if such functionality is directly available.\n\nGiven that, perhaps using the built-in list operations and counting occurrences is a way to go.\n\nHere's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each element in both lists.\n\n2. For each unique element, find the absolute difference in counts between the two lists.\n\n3. Repeat the element by the difference count in the result list.\n\nThis would handle duplicates correctly.\n\nHowever, implementing this in Midio might be complex, depending on what nodes are available for counting and iterating over unique elements.\n\nLooking back at the initial approach using \"List.Filter\", it might not handle duplicates correctly because it would just filter based on presence, not counts.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to remove the intersection from both lists and combine the remainders.\n\nBut again, this might not preserve duplicates properly.\n\nWait, maybe I can use \"List.RemoveDuplicates\" after finding the symmetric difference to handle duplicates appropriately.\n\nBut that might not be ideal.\n\nAlternatively, I can iterate through each list and for each element, check if it appears in the other list, and if so, decrement the count in both lists.\n\nThe remaining elements would be the dissimilar ones.\n\nIn Midio, this might require using loops or recursive functions, which I'm not sure are directly supported in the current node set.\n\nGiven the complexity of handling duplicates correctly, perhaps for now, I'll proceed with the initial approach of treating the lists as sets, finding the symmetric difference, and outputting the result.\n\nThis would be a simpler implementation and suitable for cases where duplicates are not considered.\n\nIf duplicates need to be handled properly, it would require a more sophisticated approach, possibly beyond the scope of the current task.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the set-based approach.\n\nHere's how I can structure the function:\n\n- Take two list inputs.\n\n- Convert each list to a set to remove duplicates.\n\n- Find the difference of set A minus set B.\n\n- Find the difference of set B minus set A.\n\n- Concatenate these two difference sets.\n\n- Output the resulting list.\n\nIn Midio, this would involve using \"List.ToSet\" to convert lists to sets, \"Sets.Difference\" to find differences, and \"List.Concat\" to combine the results.\n\nI need to ensure that the sets are properly handled and that the final output is a list, not a set, to match the expected type.\n\nAlso, I should consider the order of elements in the output. Since sets do not preserve order, the output might not be in any particular order.\n\nIf the order is important, I might need to preserve the original order from the lists, but that complicates things.\n\nFor now, let's assume that the order is not important.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio nodes:\n\n1. List.ToSet for list A.\n\n2. List.ToSet for list B.\n\n3. Sets.Difference (A - B).\n\n4. Sets.Difference (B - A).\n\n5. List.Concat to combine the two differences.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nI need to make sure that the sets are of compatible types and that the function is typed correctly.\n\nAlso, I should handle cases where one or both lists are empty.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If list A is empty, the symmetric difference should be set B.\n\n- If list B is empty, the symmetric difference should be set A.\n\n- If both are empty, the symmetric difference should be empty.\n\nI need to ensure that the function behaves correctly in these cases.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider whether the lists can contain different types of elements. In Midio, I believe functions are typed, so the lists should contain elements of the same type.\n\nAssuming that, I can proceed.\n\nLet me think about an example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [3, 4, 5]\n\nSymmetric difference should be [1, 2, 4, 5].\n\nAnother example:\n\nList A: [1, 1, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [1, 3, 4]\n\nIf treating as sets: symmetric difference is [1, 2, 4].\n\nBut if considering duplicates, it's more complex.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the set-based approach for now.\n\nIf needed, I can revisit"

                "I'm trying to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. So, if I have a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 items are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle the rotation. Rotating a list to the right by 'k' positions means that the last 'k' elements will move to the front of the list, and the rest will shift forward accordingly.\n\nI should consider edge cases as well:\n\n1. If 'k' is 0, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. If 'k' is equal to the length of the list, the list remains unchanged because rotating by the length of the list brings it back to its original position.\n\n3. If 'k' is greater than the length of the list, I should effectively rotate it by 'k modulo length of the list'.\n\n4. If the list is empty or has only one element, rotation won't change anything.\n\nI need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in code:\n\n- I can take the list and the number 'k' as inputs.\n\n- Calculate the effective rotation: k modulo the length of the list.\n\n- If the effective rotation is 0, return the original list.\n\n- Otherwise, split the list into two parts: the last 'k' elements and the first 'length - k' elements.\n\n- Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI should also consider that the list could contain any type of elements, so my function should be generic enough to handle different data types.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps with an example:\n\nTake list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSplit the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'k' elements: [4, 5]\n\n- First 'length - k' elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nConcatenate them in reverse order: [4, 5] + [1, 2, 3] = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nPerfect!\n\nAnother example:\n\nList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 7.\n\nEffective rotation: 7 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSame as above, result is [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nGood.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nList = [1], k = 3.\n\nEffective rotation: 3 modulo 1 = 0.\n\nReturn the original list: [1]\n\nList = [], k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 0 can't be calculated, but rotating an empty list by any amount should return an empty list.\n\nI need to handle the case where the list is empty.\n\nNow, in terms of code, I need to:\n\n- Accept a list and an integer 'k'.\n\n- Calculate effective_rotation = k % len(list) if list is not empty, else 0.\n\n- If effective_rotation == 0:\n\n- Return the original list.\n\n- Else:\n\n- Split the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- First 'len(list) - effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- Concatenate them: last_part + first_part.\n\n- Return the new list.\n\nI should also consider negative values of 'k', but since rotation to the right is specified, I'll assume 'k' is non-negative. If negative 'k' is allowed, it would imply rotating to the left, which is a different operation.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with 'k' being non-negative.\n\nLet me try writing a small function in pseudocode:\n\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n\nif not lst:\n\nreturn lst\n\neffective_rotation = k % len(lst)\n\nif effective_rotation == 0:\n\nreturn lst\n\nlast_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n\nfirst_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n\nreturn last_part + first_part\n\nTest this with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2:\n\nlast_part = [4,5]\n\nfirst_part = [1,2,3]\n\nreturn [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [1], k=3:\n\neffective_rotation = 3 % 1 = 0\n\nReturn [1]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [], k=2:\n\nReturn []\n\nGood.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nNow, in the actual programming language, I need to ensure that slicing works as expected.\n\nIn some languages, negative indices might not be supported, so I need to handle that.\n\nBut in Python, slicing with negative indices is fine.\n\nIf I'm using another language, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, ensuring that 'k' is an integer and handling any type of list elements.\n\nI think this approach is solid.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. This means that the last `k` elements of the list will be moved to the beginning, and the rest of the elements will shift forward accordingly.\n\n\n\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If the list is empty or `k` is zero, return the original list.\n   - If `k` is a multiple of the list's length, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Calculate Effective Rotation**:\n   - Compute the effective rotation by taking `k` modulo the length of the list to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list's length.\n\n3. **Split and Concatenate**:\n   - Split the list into two parts: the last `effective_rotation` elements and the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n   - Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation.\n\n\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    if not lst:\n        return lst\n    length = len(lst)\n    effective_rotation = k % length\n    if effective_rotation == 0:\n        return lst\n    last_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n    first_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n    return last_part + first_part\n```\n\n\n\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty list or `k = 0` will return the original list.\n   - If `k` is equal to the list's length, the rotation brings it back to the original position.\n\n2. **Effective Rotation Calculation**:\n   - Using `k % length` ensures that we handle rotations larger than the list's length efficiently.\n\n3. **List Slicing**:\n   - `lst[-effective_rotation:]` gets the last `effective_rotation` elements.\n   - `lst[:-effective_rotation]` gets the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n\n4. **Concatenation**:\n   - Combining the last part with the first part gives the rotated list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is efficient and handles all possible edge cases correctly."

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list using the provided external functions in Midio. Since there's no direct function for calculating the product, I'll need to iterate through the list, keep track of unique numbers, and multiply them together.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that I only consider unique numbers in the list. To do this, I can use a combination of list operations to filter out duplicates. Once I have a list of unique numbers, I can then calculate their product by iterating through the list and multiplying the numbers together.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates:** Use list functions to create a list of unique numbers from the input list.\n2. **Calculate Product:** Iterate through the unique numbers and calculate their product.\n\nFor step 1, I can use the `Sets.Difference` function to remove duplicates. By comparing the list with itself in a way that only unique elements remain.\n\nFor step 2, I can use the `Iteration.Map` function to iterate through the unique numbers and keep multiplying them together.\n\nHowever, since there's no direct function for multiplication in iterations, I might need to manage the accumulation manually, perhaps using a loop construct like `Std.For` and keeping track of the product as I go.\n\nLet me consider using `Math.Mul` within a loop to accumulate the product.\n\nI'll need to initialize a variable to hold the product, starting with 1 (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value), and then for each unique number, multiply it with the accumulated product.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the product of an empty list is conventionally 1.\n\nSo, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Check if the list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Otherwise, create a list of unique numbers.\n- Initialize a variable `product` to 1.\n- Iterate through the unique numbers and multiply each one to `product`.\n- Return the final product.\n\nNow, translating this into Midio code:\n\n- Use `List.IsEmpty` to check if the input list is empty.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- If not empty, use `Sets.Difference` to get unique numbers.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the unique numbers, accumulating the product.\n\nI need to make sure that the loop correctly multiplies each number to the accumulated product.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the loop:\n\n- Start with product = 1.\n- For each number in the unique list, multiply it with the current product and update product.\n\nIn Midio, using `Std.For`, I can iterate through the list, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the accumulated product.\n\nI might need to use a temporary variable or perhaps pass the accumulated value through the loop's context.\n\nWait, `Std.For` allows passing a context value that can be updated in each iteration.\n\nSo, I can initialize the context with 1, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the context value and update the context.\n\nFinally, after the loop completes, the context will hold the product of all unique numbers.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Check if input list is empty using `List.IsEmpty`.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- Else, get unique numbers using `Sets.Difference`.\n- Initialize context with 1.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through unique numbers, multiplying each with the context and updating the context.\n- After loop, output the context value.\n\nI need to make sure that `Sets.Difference` is used correctly to get unique numbers. Actually, `Sets.Difference` is for computing differences between sets, but to get unique elements, I might need a different approach.\n\nWait, Midio might have a function to get unique elements in a list. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- `List.GenerateRange`\n- `Math.LessThanOrEqual`\n- `Std.For`\n- `Logic.And`\n- `Math.Expression`\n- `Math.Add`\n- `Math.Mul`\n\nIt seems there isn't a direct function to get unique elements. I might need to implement this myself.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a new list only if it's not already present.\n\nThis would require checking for existence in the new list for each element.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list and build a new list of unique elements.\n\nSo, the plan now is:\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n2. Else, create a new list for unique elements.\n3. Iterate through the input list, adding elements to the unique list only if they're not already present.\n4. Initialize a context variable `product` to 1.\n5. Iterate through the unique list, multiplying each element with `product` and updating `product`.\n6. After the loop, output `product`.\n\nThis involves two loops: one for gathering unique elements and another for calculating the product.\n\nTo make it more efficient, perhaps I can combine steps 2 and 5 into a single loop. That is, while iterating through the input list and collecting unique elements, also multiply them to accumulate the product.\n\nThis way, I only need one loop.\n\nHere's how it can work:\n\n- Initialize `product` to 1 and an empty set to keep track of seen elements.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen set.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen set.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a set to keep track of seen elements, but since sets aren't directly available, I might need to simulate this with a list.\n\nHowever, checking for existence in a list is inefficient, as it requires iterating through the list each time.\n\nThis could be problematic for large lists, but since we're dealing with numbers and assuming the list isn't too large, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if performance is a concern, I might need to think of a different approach.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this plan.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `List.Contains` to check if an element is already in the seen list.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided functions, it seems `List.Contains` isn't directly available. I might need to implement a contains check using other functions.\n\nPerhaps using `Iteration.Map` to check for existence.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAnother approach could be to sort the list and then iterate through it, multiplying only when a new unique element is encountered.\n\nBut sorting would require additional steps and might not be straightforward with the given functions.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the simplest way is to tolerate the inefficiency and check for each element whether it's already in the seen list.\n\nHere's a high-level plan:\n\n- Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and an empty seen list.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen list.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen list.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using `Std.For` for iteration and `List.Contains` to check for existence.\n\nSince `List.Contains` isn't directly available, I might need to use `Iteration.Map` to create a contains function.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `Sets.Difference` to get unique elements by comparing the input list with itself, but that might not directly give me the unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, I can accept that managing uniqueness is complex with the given functions and proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list, accepting the performance hit.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the plan of using a seen list and checking for existence in each iteration.\n\nHere's how it would look in Midio:\n\n- Create a function `is_in_list` that checks if an element is in a list.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list, using `is_in_list` to check for uniqueness and accumulating the product.\n\nBut creating a separate function for `is_in_list` might be overkill. Maybe I can inline the contains check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use `Iteration.Map` to create a list of booleans indicating whether each element is unique, but this seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll simplify the approach:\n\n- Assume that the input list has no duplicates. This way, I can directly calculate the product without worrying about uniqueness.\n\nHowever, this doesn't satisfy the requirement of considering only unique numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can sort the list and then multiply consecutive unique elements.\n\nBut sorting isn't directly available, and implementing it would be too time-consuming.\n\nGiven this, I'll proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list to track uniqueness.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the Midio code:\n\n- Check if input list is empty. If yes, output 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and `seen` as an empty list.\n- Iterate through each element in the input list:\n- Check if the element is not in `seen`.\n- If not in `seen`, multiply it with `product` and add it to `seen`.\n- Output `product` after the loop.\n\nIn Midio, this would involve"

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions.

To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, alternating between adding and subtracting them.\n3. Check if the resulting sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIf the sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11.\n\nI'll need to use some Midio nodes to achieve this:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n- Split the string into individual characters (digits).\n- Convert each character back to a number.\n- Apply alternating addition and subtraction.\n- Check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's think about which Midio nodes can help with these steps.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. I think there's a node for that, maybe in the \"Strings\" category.\n\nNext, I need to split the string into individual characters. There should be a node for that as well, perhaps \"Strings.Characters\".\n\nThen, I need to convert each character back to a number. Maybe \"Convert.StringToNumber\".\n\nAfter that, I need to iterate through the list of numbers, alternating between adding and subtracting them. This might require a loop, like \"Std.For\", and some conditional logic.\n\nFinally, I need to check if the resulting sum is divisible by 11, which can be done using the modulo operator.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers and zero.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n2. Convert it to a string.\n3. Get all characters (digits) from the string.\n4. Convert each character to a number.\n5. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum, starting at 0.\n6. Iterate through the list of digits:\n   a. For each digit, depending on its position, add or subtract it from the sum.\n   b. You can determine whether to add or subtract based on the index: if index is even, add; if odd, subtract.\n7. After processing all digits, check if the sum is divisible by 11.\n8. Return true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI should also handle negative numbers by taking their absolute value, since divisibility doesn't depend on the sign.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nTake the number 121.\n\n- Convert to string: \"121\"\n\n- Get characters: ['1', '2', '1']\n\n- Convert to numbers: [1, 2, 1]\n\n- Initialize sum: 0\n\n- Index 0 (even): sum += 1 \u2192 sum = 1\n\n- Index 1 (odd): sum -= 2 \u2192 sum = -1\n\n- Index 2 (even): sum += 1 \u2192 sum = 0\n\n- Check if 0 is divisible by 11: yes\n\nAnother example: 123456789\n\n- Convert to string: \"123456789\"\n\n- Get characters: ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']\n\n- Convert to numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\n- Initialize sum: 0\n\n- Indices 0 to 8:\n\n- Even indices: 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 sum += 1+3+5+7+9 = 25\n\n- Odd indices: 2,4,6,8 \u2192 sum -= 2+4+6+8 = -20\n\n- Total sum: 25 - 20 = 5\n\n- 5 is not divisible by 11: false\n\nWait a minute, the standard rule for divisibility by 11 is actually to take the alternating sum of digits and check if that's divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in the first example, 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nIn the second example, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. Let's see if there's a \"ToString\" node.\n\nLooking at the \"Strings\" category, there might be a \"Convert Number to String\" node.\n\nThen, \"Strings.Characters\" can split the string into individual characters.\n\nThen, I need to convert each character back to a number.\n\nThere should be a \"Map\" function to apply \"String.ToNumber\" to each character.\n\nThen, I need to iterate through the list with indices to alternate addition and subtraction.\n\nThis might require a loop with index tracking.\n\nI can use \"Std.For\" which provides the index and item in each iteration.\n\nInside the loop, I can check if the index is even or odd using \"Modulo\".\n\nIf index % 2 == 0, add the digit to the sum; else, subtract it.\n\nFinally, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using \"Sum % 11 == 0\".\n\nI need to accumulate the sum across the loop iterations, so I might need a variable to hold the sum and update it in each iteration.\n\nIn Midio, variables are represented by nodes that can hold state.\n\nI think there's a \"Variable\" node in the \"Memory\" category.\n\nI'll need to initialize it to 0 before the loop and then update it in each iteration.\n\nAt the end, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nAlso, handle negative numbers by taking their absolute value before processing.\n\nSo, add an \"Abs\" node from the \"Math\" category.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n- Convert number to string\n\n- Strings.Characters\n\n- Map with String.ToNumber\n\n- Std.For (to iterate with index)\n\n- Modulo to check even or odd index\n\n- Conditional to decide addition or subtraction\n\n- Variable to hold the sum\n\n- Accumulate sum based on condition\n\n- Finally, check if sum % 11 == 0\n\nI need to make sure that all these nodes are available in Midio.\n\nAlso, ensure that the map function can take a function to convert each character to a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Std.For\" directly on the list of characters, converting each to a number within the loop.\n\nThat might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, here's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Convert input number to its absolute value.\n\n2. Convert the absolute value to a string.\n\n3. Get all characters in the string.\n\n4. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate through each character with its index:\n\na. Convert character to number.\n\nb. Check if index is even or odd.\n\nc. If even, add the number to sum; if odd, subtract it.\n\n5. After the loop, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nI need to make sure that \"Std.For\" provides both the index and the item in each iteration.\n\nYes, \"Std.For\" has outputs for item and index.\n\nThen, inside the loop, I can:\n\n- Convert character to number using \"String.ToNumber\"\n\n- Compute index % 2 to determine even or odd\n\n- If even, add to sum; if odd, subtract from sum\n\nI'll need a variable node to hold the sum, initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, update the sum based on the condition.\n\nAt the end of the loop, compute sum % 11 using \"Modulo\" node.\n\nThen, check if the result is zero using \"Equal\" node.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nI should also consider the case when the input number is zero. Zero is divisible by 11, so the function should return true for zero.\n\nWait, is zero considered divisible by 11? Well, mathematically, zero divided by any non-zero number is zero, so yes, zero is divisible by 11.\n\nBut in our function, if input is zero, converting to string gives \"0\", then sum is 0, and 0 % 11 == 0, so it should return true.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother consideration is negative numbers. The absolute value ensures that the sign doesn't affect the result.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to arrange the nodes in the correct order and connect them appropriately.\n\nStart with the input number.\n\nConnect it to an \"Abs\" node to get its absolute value.\n\nThen, connect the absolute value to a \"ToString\" node to convert it to a string.\n\nThen, connect the string to \"Strings.Characters\" to get a list of characters.\n\nThen, connect the list of characters to \"Std.For\".\n\nInside \"Std.For\", for each character:\n\n- Convert character to number using \"String.ToNumber\"\n\n- Get the index and compute index % 2 using \"Modulo\"\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, add the number to sum; else, subtract it\n\nI'll need a variable node to hold the sum, initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, based on the condition (index even or odd), update the sum.\n\nAfter the loop, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nI should also think about"

                "I'm trying to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, if I have two lists, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. I think it refers to the symmetric difference between the two lists. That is, elements that are in one list but not in the other, and vice versa.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations because sets have built-in methods to find differences. However, since lists can contain duplicate elements and sets do not, I need to consider whether duplicates should be preserved or not.\n\nAssuming that duplicates are allowed in the lists and should be considered, I might need to approach this differently. But for simplicity, let's first consider the elements without worrying about duplicates, treating them as sets.\n\nSo, I can convert both lists to sets and then find the symmetric difference between these sets. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nIn Midio, I need to find the nodes that can help me achieve this. Looking at the list of external functions provided, I see \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, meaning elements in the first list that are not in the second.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I need to find elements that are in the first list but not in the second, and elements that are in the second list but not in the first, and then combine these two results.\n\nSo, I can use \"Sets.Difference\" twice: once for A minus B, and once for B minus A, and then concatenate the results.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create a function that takes two lists as input and outputs the symmetric difference.\n\nI should also consider the order of elements in the output. Since sets don't preserve order, if the order is important, I might need to handle it differently.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that the order is not important, and we can treat the lists as sets.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Convert both input lists to sets to remove duplicates and easily perform set operations.\n\n2. Use \"Sets.Difference\" to find elements in the first set that are not in the second set.\n\n3. Use \"Sets.Difference\" again to find elements in the second set that are not in the first set.\n\n4. Combine these two difference sets using \"List.Concat\" to get the symmetric difference.\n\n5. Output the resulting list.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the function handles empty lists gracefully and that it doesn't lose any elements that might be duplicates in the original lists if duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait a minute, the task says \"dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\" If duplicates are present, perhaps they should be considered. For example, if list A has [1, 2, 2, 3] and list B has [2, 3, 4], the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], considering the counts.\n\nBut treating them as sets, the symmetric difference would be [1, 2, 4], which matches this case. But in sets, '2' appears only once, whereas in lists, duplicates are possible.\n\nIf duplicates need to be preserved, I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should iterate through both lists and collect elements that are not present in the other list, considering duplicates.\n\nThis might be more complex. Let's consider this step by step.\n\nFirst, for list A, find elements that are not in list B, preserving duplicates.\n\nThen, for list B, find elements not in list A, preserving duplicates.\n\nFinally, combine these two results.\n\nIn Midio, I can use list filtering or some form of iteration to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there's \"List.Filter\" which can be used to filter elements based on a condition.\n\nSo, for list A, I can filter elements that are not in list B.\n\nSimilarly, for list B, filter elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate these two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nI'll need to create two filter operations: one for each list, filtering out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function can handle lists of different types, but in Midio, types are specified, so I'll need to define the function with specific types or make it generic if possible.\n\nAssuming the lists contain elements of the same type, I can proceed.\n\nAnother consideration is performance. If the lists are large, using filters might not be efficient because it could involve nested loops.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert one list to a set for faster lookups, and then filter the other list based on that set.\n\nThis would improve efficiency, especially for larger lists.\n\nSo, in Midio, I can convert one list to a set using \"List.ToSet\", and then use that set in the filter condition for the other list.\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nThis should be more efficient.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Convert list B to a set for faster lookups.\n\n2. Filter list A to include only elements not present in the set from list B.\n\n3. Convert list A to a set.\n\n4. Filter list B to include only elements not present in the set from list A.\n\n5. Concatenate the results of the two filters.\n\n6. Output the combined list.\n\nThis should give me the dissimilar elements from both lists, preserving duplicates.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [2, 3, 4]\n\nSet B: {2, 3, 4}\n\nFilter list A: elements not in set B -> [1]\n\nSet A: {1, 2, 3}\n\nFilter list B: elements not in set A -> [4]\n\nConcatenate: [1] + [4] = [1, 4]\n\nBut according to the symmetric difference, this is correct.\n\nHowever, in the earlier assumption considering duplicates, it might be [1, 2, 4], but that's if duplicates are considered separately, which may not be the case in set operations.\n\nI need to clarify whether duplicates should be preserved or not.\n\nIf duplicates are allowed in the input lists and should be included in the output if they don't have a matching duplicate in the other list, then I need a different approach.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements should be [1, 2, 4], because there are two 2's in A but only one in B, so one 2 remains dissimilar.\n\nThis seems more complex. I might need to count the occurrences of each element in both lists and then find the difference in counts.\n\nThen, for each element, if the counts differ, include the differing number of elements in the output.\n\nThis would require counting the frequency of each element in both lists and then finding the difference in counts.\n\nIn Midio, I can use \"List.CountBy\" to count occurrences of each element in the lists.\n\nThen, for each unique element, find the absolute difference in counts between the two lists, and include that many elements in the output.\n\nThis seems like a more accurate way to handle duplicates.\n\nLet's consider the previous example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [2, 3, 4]\n\nCounts for A: 1:1, 2:2, 3:1\n\nCounts for B: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1\n\nDifferences:\n\n- 1: 1 - 0 = 1 -> include 1 once\n\n- 2: 2 - 1 = 1 -> include 2 once\n\n- 3: 1 - 1 = 0 -> exclude 3\n\n- 4: 0 - 1 = 1 -> include 4 once\n\nSo, the dissimilar elements are [1, 2, 4], which matches the earlier assumption.\n\nThis approach seems more comprehensive.\n\nIn Midio, I can:\n\n1. Count occurrences of each element in both lists using \"List.CountBy\".\n\n2. Combine the unique elements from both counts.\n\n3. For each unique element, calculate the absolute difference in counts between the two lists.\n\n4. Repeat each element by the difference in counts.\n\n5. Collect all these elements into a single list.\n\nThis requires some form of iteration over the unique elements and repeating them according to the count difference.\n\nIn Midio, I can use \"List.Map\" and \"List.Flatten\" to achieve this.\n\nHere's a rough outline:\n\n- Use \"List.CountBy\" on list A and list B.\n\n- Combine the keys from both counts.\n\n- For each unique key, calculate the absolute difference in counts.\n\n- Repeat the element by the difference count.\n\n- Flatten the list of repeated elements.\n\nThis should give me the desired list of dissimilar elements, preserving duplicates appropriately.\n\nI need to make sure that I handle elements that are present in one list but not in the other, as their counts would be unequal.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that I cover all unique elements from both lists when calculating differences.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Mid"

                "I'm trying to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. So, if I have a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 items are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle the rotation. Rotating a list to the right by 'k' positions means that the last 'k' elements will move to the front of the list, and the rest will shift forward accordingly.\n\nI should consider edge cases as well:\n\n1. If 'k' is 0, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. If 'k' is equal to the length of the list, the list remains unchanged because rotating by the length of the list brings it back to its original position.\n\n3. If 'k' is greater than the length of the list, I should effectively rotate it by 'k modulo length of the list'.\n\n4. If the list is empty or has only one element, rotation won't change anything.\n\nI need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in code:\n\n- I can take the list and the number 'k' as inputs.\n\n- Calculate the effective rotation: k modulo the length of the list.\n\n- If the effective rotation is 0, return the original list.\n\n- Otherwise, split the list into two parts: the last 'k' elements and the first 'length - k' elements.\n\n- Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI should also consider that the list could contain any type of elements, so my function should be generic enough to handle different data types.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps with an example:\n\nTake list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSplit the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'k' elements: [4, 5]\n\n- First 'length - k' elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nConcatenate them in reverse order: [4, 5] + [1, 2, 3] = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nPerfect!\n\nAnother example:\n\nList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 7.\n\nEffective rotation: 7 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSame as above, result is [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nGood.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nList = [1], k = 3.\n\nEffective rotation: 3 modulo 1 = 0.\n\nReturn the original list: [1]\n\nList = [], k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 0 can't be calculated, but rotating an empty list by any amount should return an empty list.\n\nI need to handle the case where the list is empty.\n\nNow, in terms of code, I need to:\n\n- Accept a list and an integer 'k'.\n\n- Calculate effective_rotation = k % len(list) if list is not empty, else 0.\n\n- If effective_rotation == 0:\n\n- Return the original list.\n\n- Else:\n\n- Split the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- First 'len(list) - effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- Concatenate them: last_part + first_part.\n\n- Return the new list.\n\nI should also consider negative values of 'k', but since rotation to the right is specified, I'll assume 'k' is non-negative. If negative 'k' is allowed, it would imply rotating to the left, which is a different operation.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with 'k' being non-negative.\n\nLet me try writing a small function in pseudocode:\n\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n\nif not lst:\n\nreturn lst\n\neffective_rotation = k % len(lst)\n\nif effective_rotation == 0:\n\nreturn lst\n\nlast_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n\nfirst_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n\nreturn last_part + first_part\n\nTest this with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2:\n\nlast_part = [4,5]\n\nfirst_part = [1,2,3]\n\nreturn [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [1], k=3:\n\neffective_rotation = 3 % 1 = 0\n\nReturn [1]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [], k=2:\n\nReturn []\n\nGood.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nNow, in the actual programming language, I need to ensure that slicing works as expected.\n\nIn some languages, negative indices might not be supported, so I need to handle that.\n\nBut in Python, slicing with negative indices is fine.\n\nIf I'm using another language, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, ensuring that 'k' is an integer and handling any type of list elements.\n\nI think this approach is solid.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. This means that the last `k` elements of the list will be moved to the beginning, and the rest of the elements will shift forward accordingly.\n\n\n\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If the list is empty or `k` is zero, return the original list.\n   - If `k` is a multiple of the list's length, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Calculate Effective Rotation**:\n   - Compute the effective rotation by taking `k` modulo the length of the list to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list's length.\n\n3. **Split and Concatenate**:\n   - Split the list into two parts: the last `effective_rotation` elements and the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n   - Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation.\n\n\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    if not lst:\n        return lst\n    length = len(lst)\n    effective_rotation = k % length\n    if effective_rotation == 0:\n        return lst\n    last_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n    first_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n    return last_part + first_part\n```\n\n\n\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty list or `k = 0` will return the original list.\n   - If `k` is equal to the list's length, the rotation brings it back to the original position.\n\n2. **Effective Rotation Calculation**:\n   - Using `k % length` ensures that we handle rotations larger than the list's length efficiently.\n\n3. **List Slicing**:\n   - `lst[-effective_rotation:]` gets the last `effective_rotation` elements.\n   - `lst[:-effective_rotation]` gets the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n\n4. **Concatenation**:\n   - Combining the last part with the first part gives the rotated list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is efficient and handles all possible edge cases correctly."

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list using the provided external functions in Midio. Since there's no direct function for calculating the product, I'll need to iterate through the list, keep track of unique numbers, and multiply them together.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that I only consider unique numbers in the list. To do this, I can use a combination of list operations to filter out duplicates. Once I have a list of unique numbers, I can then calculate their product by iterating through the list and multiplying the numbers together.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates:** Use list functions to create a list of unique numbers from the input list.\n2. **Calculate Product:** Iterate through the unique numbers and calculate their product.\n\nFor step 1, I can use the `Sets.Difference` function to remove duplicates. By comparing the list with itself in a way that only unique elements remain.\n\nFor step 2, I can use the `Iteration.Map` function to iterate through the unique numbers and keep multiplying them together.\n\nHowever, since there's no direct function for multiplication in iterations, I might need to manage the accumulation manually, perhaps using a loop construct like `Std.For` and keeping track of the product as I go.\n\nLet me consider using `Math.Mul` within a loop to accumulate the product.\n\nI'll need to initialize a variable to hold the product, starting with 1 (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value), and then for each unique number, multiply it with the accumulated product.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the product of an empty list is conventionally 1.\n\nSo, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Check if the list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Otherwise, create a list of unique numbers.\n- Initialize a variable `product` to 1.\n- Iterate through the unique numbers and multiply each one to `product`.\n- Return the final product.\n\nNow, translating this into Midio code:\n\n- Use `List.IsEmpty` to check if the input list is empty.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- If not empty, use `Sets.Difference` to get unique numbers.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the unique numbers, accumulating the product.\n\nI need to make sure that the loop correctly multiplies each number to the accumulated product.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the loop:\n\n- Start with product = 1.\n- For each number in the unique list, multiply it with the current product and update product.\n\nIn Midio, using `Std.For`, I can iterate through the list, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the accumulated product.\n\nI might need to use a temporary variable or perhaps pass the accumulated value through the loop's context.\n\nWait, `Std.For` allows passing a context value that can be updated in each iteration.\n\nSo, I can initialize the context with 1, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the context value and update the context.\n\nFinally, after the loop completes, the context will hold the product of all unique numbers.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Check if input list is empty using `List.IsEmpty`.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- Else, get unique numbers using `Sets.Difference`.\n- Initialize context with 1.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through unique numbers, multiplying each with the context and updating the context.\n- After loop, output the context value.\n\nI need to make sure that `Sets.Difference` is used correctly to get unique numbers. Actually, `Sets.Difference` is for computing differences between sets, but to get unique elements, I might need a different approach.\n\nWait, Midio might have a function to get unique elements in a list. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- `List.GenerateRange`\n- `Math.LessThanOrEqual`\n- `Std.For`\n- `Logic.And`\n- `Math.Expression`\n- `Math.Add`\n- `Math.Mul`\n\nIt seems there isn't a direct function to get unique elements. I might need to implement this myself.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a new list only if it's not already present.\n\nThis would require checking for existence in the new list for each element.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list and build a new list of unique elements.\n\nSo, the plan now is:\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n2. Else, create a new list for unique elements.\n3. Iterate through the input list, adding elements to the unique list only if they're not already present.\n4. Initialize a context variable `product` to 1.\n5. Iterate through the unique list, multiplying each element with `product` and updating `product`.\n6. After the loop, output `product`.\n\nThis involves two loops: one for gathering unique elements and another for calculating the product.\n\nTo make it more efficient, perhaps I can combine steps 2 and 5 into a single loop. That is, while iterating through the input list and collecting unique elements, also multiply them to accumulate the product.\n\nThis way, I only need one loop.\n\nHere's how it can work:\n\n- Initialize `product` to 1 and an empty set to keep track of seen elements.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen set.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen set.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a set to keep track of seen elements, but since sets aren't directly available, I might need to simulate this with a list.\n\nHowever, checking for existence in a list is inefficient, as it requires iterating through the list each time.\n\nThis could be problematic for large lists, but since we're dealing with numbers and assuming the list isn't too large, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if performance is a concern, I might need to think of a different approach.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this plan.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `List.Contains` to check if an element is already in the seen list.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided functions, it seems `List.Contains` isn't directly available. I might need to implement a contains check using other functions.\n\nPerhaps using `Iteration.Map` to check for existence.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAnother approach could be to sort the list and then iterate through it, multiplying only when a new unique element is encountered.\n\nBut sorting would require additional steps and might not be straightforward with the given functions.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the simplest way is to tolerate the inefficiency and check for each element whether it's already in the seen list.\n\nHere's a high-level plan:\n\n- Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and an empty seen list.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen list.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen list.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using `Std.For` for iteration and `List.Contains` to check for existence.\n\nSince `List.Contains` isn't directly available, I might need to use `Iteration.Map` to create a contains function.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `Sets.Difference` to get unique elements by comparing the input list with itself, but that might not directly give me the unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, I can accept that managing uniqueness is complex with the given functions and proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list, accepting the performance hit.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the plan of using a seen list and checking for existence in each iteration.\n\nHere's how it would look in Midio:\n\n- Create a function `is_in_list` that checks if an element is in a list.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list, using `is_in_list` to check for uniqueness and accumulating the product.\n\nBut creating a separate function for `is_in_list` might be overkill. Maybe I can inline the contains check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use `Iteration.Map` to create a list of booleans indicating whether each element is unique, but this seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll simplify the approach:\n\n- Assume that the input list has no duplicates. This way, I can directly calculate the product without worrying about uniqueness.\n\nHowever, this doesn't satisfy the requirement of considering only unique numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can sort the list and then multiply consecutive unique elements.\n\nBut sorting isn't directly available, and implementing it would be too time-consuming.\n\nGiven this, I'll proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list to track uniqueness.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the Midio code:\n\n- Check if input list is empty. If yes, output 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and `seen` as an empty list.\n- Iterate through each element in the input list:\n- Check if the element is not in `seen`.\n- If not in `seen`, multiply it with `product` and add it to `seen`.\n- Output `product` after the loop.\n\nIn Midio, this would involve"

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, alternating between adding and subtracting them.\n3. Check if the resulting sum is divisible by 11.\n\nIf the sum is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11.\n\nI'll need to use some Midio nodes to achieve this:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n- Split the string into individual characters (digits).\n- Convert each character back to a number.\n- Apply alternating addition and subtraction.\n- Check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's think about which Midio nodes can help with these steps.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. I think there's a node for that, maybe in the \"Strings\" category.\n\nNext, I need to split the string into individual characters. There should be a node for that as well, perhaps \"Strings.Characters\".\n\nThen, I need to convert each character back to a number. Maybe \"Convert.StringToNumber\".\n\nAfter that, I need to iterate through the list of numbers, alternating between adding and subtracting them. This might require a loop, like \"Std.For\", and some conditional logic.\n\nFinally, I need to check if the resulting sum is divisible by 11, which can be done using the modulo operator.\n\nI should also consider negative numbers and zero.\n\nLet me sketch out the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n2. Convert it to a string.\n3. Get all characters (digits) from the string.\n4. Convert each character to a number.\n5. Initialize a variable to hold the alternating sum, starting at 0.\n6. Iterate through the list of digits:\n   a. For each digit, depending on its position, add or subtract it from the sum.\n   b. You can determine whether to add or subtract based on the index: if index is even, add; if odd, subtract.\n7. After processing all digits, check if the sum is divisible by 11.\n8. Return true if it is, false otherwise.\n\nI should also handle negative numbers by taking their absolute value, since divisibility doesn't depend on the sign.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nTake the number 121.\n\n- Convert to string: \"121\"\n\n- Get characters: ['1', '2', '1']\n\n- Convert to numbers: [1, 2, 1]\n\n- Initialize sum: 0\n\n- Index 0 (even): sum += 1 \u2192 sum = 1\n\n- Index 1 (odd): sum -= 2 \u2192 sum = -1\n\n- Index 2 (even): sum += 1 \u2192 sum = 0\n\n- Check if 0 is divisible by 11: yes\n\nAnother example: 123456789\n\n- Convert to string: \"123456789\"\n\n- Get characters: ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']\n\n- Convert to numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\n\n- Initialize sum: 0\n\n- Indices 0 to 8:\n\n- Even indices: 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 sum += 1+3+5+7+9 = 25\n\n- Odd indices: 2,4,6,8 \u2192 sum -= 2+4+6+8 = -20\n\n- Total sum: 25 - 20 = 5\n\n- 5 is not divisible by 11: false\n\nWait a minute, the standard rule for divisibility by 11 is actually to take the alternating sum of digits and check if that's divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in the first example, 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nIn the second example, 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 + 9 = 5, which is not divisible by 11.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, in Midio, I need to implement this logic.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. Let's see if there's a \"ToString\" node.\n\nLooking at the \"Strings\" category, there might be a \"Convert Number to String\" node.\n\nThen, \"Strings.Characters\" can split the string into individual characters.\n\nThen, I need to convert each character back to a number.\n\nThere should be a \"Map\" function to apply \"String.ToNumber\" to each character.\n\nThen, I need to iterate through the list with indices to alternate addition and subtraction.\n\nThis might require a loop with index tracking.\n\nI can use \"Std.For\" which provides the index and item in each iteration.\n\nInside the loop, I can check if the index is even or odd using \"Modulo\".\n\nIf index % 2 == 0, add the digit to the sum; else, subtract it.\n\nFinally, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using \"Sum % 11 == 0\".\n\nI need to accumulate the sum across the loop iterations, so I might need a variable to hold the sum and update it in each iteration.\n\nIn Midio, variables are represented by nodes that can hold state.\n\nI think there's a \"Variable\" node in the \"Memory\" category.\n\nI'll need to initialize it to 0 before the loop and then update it in each iteration.\n\nAt the end, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nAlso, handle negative numbers by taking their absolute value before processing.\n\nSo, add an \"Abs\" node from the \"Math\" category.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n- Convert number to string\n\n- Strings.Characters\n\n- Map with String.ToNumber\n\n- Std.For (to iterate with index)\n\n- Modulo to check even or odd index\n\n- Conditional to decide addition or subtraction\n\n- Variable to hold the sum\n\n- Accumulate sum based on condition\n\n- Finally, check if sum % 11 == 0\n\nI need to make sure that all these nodes are available in Midio.\n\nAlso, ensure that the map function can take a function to convert each character to a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Std.For\" directly on the list of characters, converting each to a number within the loop.\n\nThat might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, here's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Convert input number to its absolute value.\n\n2. Convert the absolute value to a string.\n\n3. Get all characters in the string.\n\n4. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate through each character with its index:\n\na. Convert character to number.\n\nb. Check if index is even or odd.\n\nc. If even, add the number to sum; if odd, subtract it.\n\n5. After the loop, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nI need to make sure that \"Std.For\" provides both the index and the item in each iteration.\n\nYes, \"Std.For\" has outputs for item and index.\n\nThen, inside the loop, I can:\n\n- Convert character to number using \"String.ToNumber\"\n\n- Compute index % 2 to determine even or odd\n\n- If even, add to sum; if odd, subtract from sum\n\nI'll need a variable node to hold the sum, initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, update the sum based on the condition.\n\nAt the end of the loop, compute sum % 11 using \"Modulo\" node.\n\nThen, check if the result is zero using \"Equal\" node.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nI should also consider the case when the input number is zero. Zero is divisible by 11, so the function should return true for zero.\n\nWait, is zero considered divisible by 11? Well, mathematically, zero divided by any non-zero number is zero, so yes, zero is divisible by 11.\n\nBut in our function, if input is zero, converting to string gives \"0\", then sum is 0, and 0 % 11 == 0, so it should return true.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother consideration is negative numbers. The absolute value ensures that the sign doesn't affect the result.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI need to arrange the nodes in the correct order and connect them appropriately.\n\nStart with the input number.\n\nConnect it to an \"Abs\" node to get its absolute value.\n\nThen, connect the absolute value to a \"ToString\" node to convert it to a string.\n\nThen, connect the string to \"Strings.Characters\" to get a list of characters.\n\nThen, connect the list of characters to \"Std.For\".\n\nInside \"Std.For\", for each character:\n\n- Convert character to number using \"String.ToNumber\"\n\n- Get the index and compute index % 2 using \"Modulo\"\n\n- If index % 2 == 0, add the number to sum; else, subtract it\n\nI'll need a variable node to hold the sum, initialized to 0 before the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, based on the condition (index even or odd), update the sum.\n\nAfter the loop, compute sum % 11 and check if it's zero.\n\nFinally, output the result.\n\nI should also think about"

                "I'm trying to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, if I have two lists, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. I think it refers to the symmetric difference between the two lists. That is, elements that are in one list but not in the other, and vice versa.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations because sets have built-in methods to find differences. However, since lists can contain duplicate elements and sets do not, I need to consider whether duplicates should be preserved or not.\n\nAssuming that duplicates are allowed in the lists and should be considered, I might need to approach this differently. But for simplicity, let's first consider the elements without worrying about duplicates, treating them as sets.\n\nSo, I can convert both lists to sets and then find the symmetric difference between these sets. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets A or B but not in their intersection.\n\nIn Midio, I need to find the nodes that can help me achieve this. Looking at the list of external functions provided, I see \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, meaning elements in the first list that are not in the second.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I need to find elements that are in the first list but not in the second, and elements that are in the second list but not in the first, and then combine these two results.\n\nSo, I can use \"Sets.Difference\" twice: once for A minus B, and once for B minus A, and then concatenate the results.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio. I need to create a function that takes two lists as input and outputs the symmetric difference.\n\nI should also consider the order of elements in the output. Since sets don't preserve order, if the order is important, I might need to handle it differently.\n\nBut for now, let's assume that the order is not important, and we can treat the lists as sets.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Convert both input lists to sets to remove duplicates and easily perform set operations.\n\n2. Use \"Sets.Difference\" to find elements in the first set that are not in the second set.\n\n3. Use \"Sets.Difference\" again to find elements in the second set that are not in the first set.\n\n4. Combine these two difference sets using \"List.Concat\" to get the symmetric difference.\n\n5. Output the resulting list.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that the function handles empty lists gracefully and that it doesn't lose any elements that might be duplicates in the original lists if duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait a minute, the task says \"dissimilar elements in the given two lists.\" If duplicates are present, perhaps they should be considered. For example, if list A has [1, 2, 2, 3] and list B has [2, 3, 4], the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], considering the counts.\n\nBut treating them as sets, the symmetric difference would be [1, 2, 4], which matches this case. But in sets, '2' appears only once, whereas in lists, duplicates are possible.\n\nIf duplicates need to be preserved, I need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should iterate through both lists and collect elements that are not present in the other list, considering duplicates.\n\nThis might be more complex. Let's consider this step by step.\n\nFirst, for list A, find elements that are not in list B, preserving duplicates.\n\nThen, for list B, find elements not in list A, preserving duplicates.\n\nFinally, combine these two results.\n\nIn Midio, I can use list filtering or some form of iteration to achieve this.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there's \"List.Filter\" which can be used to filter elements based on a condition.\n\nSo, for list A, I can filter elements that are not in list B.\n\nSimilarly, for list B, filter elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate these two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nI'll need to create two filter operations: one for each list, filtering out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that the function can handle lists of different types, but in Midio, types are specified, so I'll need to define the function with specific types or make it generic if possible.\n\nAssuming the lists contain elements of the same type, I can proceed.\n\nAnother consideration is performance. If the lists are large, using filters might not be efficient because it could involve nested loops.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert one list to a set for faster lookups, and then filter the other list based on that set.\n\nThis would improve efficiency, especially for larger lists.\n\nSo, in Midio, I can convert one list to a set using \"List.ToSet\", and then use that set in the filter condition for the other list.\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nThis should be more efficient.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Convert list B to a set for faster lookups.\n\n2. Filter list A to include only elements not present in the set from list B.\n\n3. Convert list A to a set.\n\n4. Filter list B to include only elements not present in the set from list A.\n\n5. Concatenate the results of the two filters.\n\n6. Output the combined list.\n\nThis should give me the dissimilar elements from both lists, preserving duplicates.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [2, 3, 4]\n\nSet B: {2, 3, 4}\n\nFilter list A: elements not in set B -> [1]\n\nSet A: {1, 2, 3}\n\nFilter list B: elements not in set A -> [4]\n\nConcatenate: [1] + [4] = [1, 4]\n\nBut according to the symmetric difference, this is correct.\n\nHowever, in the earlier assumption considering duplicates, it might be [1, 2, 4], but that's if duplicates are considered separately, which may not be the case in set operations.\n\nI need to clarify whether duplicates should be preserved or not.\n\nIf duplicates are allowed in the input lists and should be included in the output if they don't have a matching duplicate in the other list, then I need a different approach.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements should be [1, 2, 4], because there are two 2's in A but only one in B, so one 2 remains dissimilar.\n\nThis seems more complex. I might need to count the occurrences of each element in both lists and then find the difference in counts.\n\nThen, for each element, if the counts differ, include the differing number of elements in the output.\n\nThis would require counting the frequency of each element in both lists and then finding the difference in counts.\n\nIn Midio, I can use \"List.CountBy\" to count occurrences of each element in the lists.\n\nThen, for each unique element, find the absolute difference in counts between the two lists, and include that many elements in the output.\n\nThis seems like a more accurate way to handle duplicates.\n\nLet's consider the previous example:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 2, 3]\n\nList B: [2, 3, 4]\n\nCounts for A: 1:1, 2:2, 3:1\n\nCounts for B: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1\n\nDifferences:\n\n- 1: 1 - 0 = 1 -> include 1 once\n\n- 2: 2 - 1 = 1 -> include 2 once\n\n- 3: 1 - 1 = 0 -> exclude 3\n\n- 4: 0 - 1 = 1 -> include 4 once\n\nSo, the dissimilar elements are [1, 2, 4], which matches the earlier assumption.\n\nThis approach seems more comprehensive.\n\nIn Midio, I can:\n\n1.

                "I'm trying to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. So, if I have a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the result should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 items are moved to the beginning of the list.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle the rotation. Rotating a list to the right by 'k' positions means that the last 'k' elements will move to the front of the list, and the rest will shift forward accordingly.\n\nI should consider edge cases as well:\n\n1. If 'k' is 0, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. If 'k' is equal to the length of the list, the list remains unchanged because rotating by the length of the list brings it back to its original position.\n\n3. If 'k' is greater than the length of the list, I should effectively rotate it by 'k modulo length of the list'.\n\n4. If the list is empty or has only one element, rotation won't change anything.\n\nI need to make sure that my function handles these cases correctly.\n\nNow, thinking about how to implement this in code:\n\n- I can take the list and the number 'k' as inputs.\n\n- Calculate the effective rotation: k modulo the length of the list.\n\n- If the effective rotation is 0, return the original list.\n\n- Otherwise, split the list into two parts: the last 'k' elements and the first 'length - k' elements.\n\n- Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to get the rotated list.\n\nI should also consider that the list could contain any type of elements, so my function should be generic enough to handle different data types.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps with an example:\n\nTake list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSplit the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'k' elements: [4, 5]\n\n- First 'length - k' elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nConcatenate them in reverse order: [4, 5] + [1, 2, 3] = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nPerfect!\n\nAnother example:\n\nList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 7.\n\nEffective rotation: 7 modulo 5 = 2.\n\nSame as above, result is [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nGood.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nList = [1], k = 3.\n\nEffective rotation: 3 modulo 1 = 0.\n\nReturn the original list: [1]\n\nList = [], k = 2.\n\nEffective rotation: 2 modulo 0 can't be calculated, but rotating an empty list by any amount should return an empty list.\n\nI need to handle the case where the list is empty.\n\nNow, in terms of code, I need to:\n\n- Accept a list and an integer 'k'.\n\n- Calculate effective_rotation = k % len(list) if list is not empty, else 0.\n\n- If effective_rotation == 0:\n\n- Return the original list.\n\n- Else:\n\n- Split the list into two parts:\n\n- Last 'effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- First 'len(list) - effective_rotation' elements.\n\n- Concatenate them: last_part + first_part.\n\n- Return the new list.\n\nI should also consider negative values of 'k', but since rotation to the right is specified, I'll assume 'k' is non-negative. If negative 'k' is allowed, it would imply rotating to the left, which is a different operation.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with 'k' being non-negative.\n\nLet me try writing a small function in pseudocode:\n\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n\nif not lst:\n\nreturn lst\n\neffective_rotation = k % len(lst)\n\nif effective_rotation == 0:\n\nreturn lst\n\nlast_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n\nfirst_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n\nreturn last_part + first_part\n\nTest this with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2:\n\nlast_part = [4,5]\n\nfirst_part = [1,2,3]\n\nreturn [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [1], k=3:\n\neffective_rotation = 3 % 1 = 0\n\nReturn [1]\n\nGood.\n\nWith [], k=2:\n\nReturn []\n\nGood.\n\nSeems straightforward.\n\nNow, in the actual programming language, I need to ensure that slicing works as expected.\n\nIn some languages, negative indices might not be supported, so I need to handle that.\n\nBut in Python, slicing with negative indices is fine.\n\nIf I'm using another language, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, ensuring that 'k' is an integer and handling any type of list elements.\n\nI think this approach is solid.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right. This means that the last `k` elements of the list will be moved to the beginning, and the rest of the elements will shift forward accordingly.\n\n\n\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If the list is empty or `k` is zero, return the original list.\n   - If `k` is a multiple of the list's length, the list remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Calculate Effective Rotation**:\n   - Compute the effective rotation by taking `k` modulo the length of the list to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list's length.\n\n3. **Split and Concatenate**:\n   - Split the list into two parts: the last `effective_rotation` elements and the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n   - Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation.\n\n\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    if not lst:\n        return lst\n    length = len(lst)\n    effective_rotation = k % length\n    if effective_rotation == 0:\n        return lst\n    last_part = lst[-effective_rotation:]\n    first_part = lst[:-effective_rotation]\n    return last_part + first_part\n```\n\n\n\n1. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty list or `k = 0` will return the original list.\n   - If `k` is equal to the list's length, the rotation brings it back to the original position.\n\n2. **Effective Rotation Calculation**:\n   - Using `k % length` ensures that we handle rotations larger than the list's length efficiently.\n\n3. **List Slicing**:\n   - `lst[-effective_rotation:]` gets the last `effective_rotation` elements.\n   - `lst[:-effective_rotation]` gets the first `length - effective_rotation` elements.\n\n4. **Concatenation**:\n   - Combining the last part with the first part gives the rotated list.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function is efficient and handles all possible edge cases correctly."

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list using the provided external functions in Midio. Since there's no direct function for calculating the product, I'll need to iterate through the list, keep track of unique numbers, and multiply them together.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that I only consider unique numbers in the list. To do this, I can use a combination of list operations to filter out duplicates. Once I have a list of unique numbers, I can then calculate their product by iterating through the list and multiplying the numbers together.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Remove Duplicates:** Use list functions to create a list of unique numbers from the input list.\n2. **Calculate Product:** Iterate through the unique numbers and calculate their product.\n\nFor step 1, I can use the `Sets.Difference` function to remove duplicates. By comparing the list with itself in a way that only unique elements remain.\n\nFor step 2, I can use the `Iteration.Map` function to iterate through the unique numbers and keep multiplying them together.\n\nHowever, since there's no direct function for multiplication in iterations, I might need to manage the accumulation manually, perhaps using a loop construct like `Std.For` and keeping track of the product as I go.\n\nLet me consider using `Math.Mul` within a loop to accumulate the product.\n\nI'll need to initialize a variable to hold the product, starting with 1 (since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value), and then for each unique number, multiply it with the accumulated product.\n\nAlso, I should handle the case where the list is empty. In that case, the product of an empty list is conventionally 1.\n\nSo, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Check if the list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Otherwise, create a list of unique numbers.\n- Initialize a variable `product` to 1.\n- Iterate through the unique numbers and multiply each one to `product`.\n- Return the final product.\n\nNow, translating this into Midio code:\n\n- Use `List.IsEmpty` to check if the input list is empty.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- If not empty, use `Sets.Difference` to get unique numbers.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the unique numbers, accumulating the product.\n\nI need to make sure that the loop correctly multiplies each number to the accumulated product.\n\nLet me think about how to set up the loop:\n\n- Start with product = 1.\n- For each number in the unique list, multiply it with the current product and update product.\n\nIn Midio, using `Std.For`, I can iterate through the list, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the accumulated product.\n\nI might need to use a temporary variable or perhaps pass the accumulated value through the loop's context.\n\nWait, `Std.For` allows passing a context value that can be updated in each iteration.\n\nSo, I can initialize the context with 1, and in each iteration, multiply the current item with the context value and update the context.\n\nFinally, after the loop completes, the context will hold the product of all unique numbers.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me sketch this out:\n\n- Check if input list is empty using `List.IsEmpty`.\n- If empty, output 1.\n- Else, get unique numbers using `Sets.Difference`.\n- Initialize context with 1.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through unique numbers, multiplying each with the context and updating the context.\n- After loop, output the context value.\n\nI need to make sure that `Sets.Difference` is used correctly to get unique numbers. Actually, `Sets.Difference` is for computing differences between sets, but to get unique elements, I might need a different approach.\n\nWait, Midio might have a function to get unique elements in a list. Let me check the available functions.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions:\n\n- `List.GenerateRange`\n- `Math.LessThanOrEqual`\n- `Std.For`\n- `Logic.And`\n- `Math.Expression`\n- `Math.Add`\n- `Math.Mul`\n\nIt seems there isn't a direct function to get unique elements. I might need to implement this myself.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a new list only if it's not already present.\n\nThis would require checking for existence in the new list for each element.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list and build a new list of unique elements.\n\nSo, the plan now is:\n\n1. Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n2. Else, create a new list for unique elements.\n3. Iterate through the input list, adding elements to the unique list only if they're not already present.\n4. Initialize a context variable `product` to 1.\n5. Iterate through the unique list, multiplying each element with `product` and updating `product`.\n6. After the loop, output `product`.\n\nThis involves two loops: one for gathering unique elements and another for calculating the product.\n\nTo make it more efficient, perhaps I can combine steps 2 and 5 into a single loop. That is, while iterating through the input list and collecting unique elements, also multiply them to accumulate the product.\n\nThis way, I only need one loop.\n\nHere's how it can work:\n\n- Initialize `product` to 1 and an empty set to keep track of seen elements.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen set.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen set.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use a set to keep track of seen elements, but since sets aren't directly available, I might need to simulate this with a list.\n\nHowever, checking for existence in a list is inefficient, as it requires iterating through the list each time.\n\nThis could be problematic for large lists, but since we're dealing with numbers and assuming the list isn't too large, it should be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, if performance is a concern, I might need to think of a different approach.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this plan.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `List.Contains` to check if an element is already in the seen list.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided functions, it seems `List.Contains` isn't directly available. I might need to implement a contains check using other functions.\n\nPerhaps using `Iteration.Map` to check for existence.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAnother approach could be to sort the list and then iterate through it, multiplying only when a new unique element is encountered.\n\nBut sorting would require additional steps and might not be straightforward with the given functions.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the simplest way is to tolerate the inefficiency and check for each element whether it's already in the seen list.\n\nHere's a high-level plan:\n\n- Check if the input list is empty. If yes, return 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and an empty seen list.\n- Iterate through the input list:\n- For each element, check if it's not in the seen list.\n- If not in seen:\n- Add it to the seen list.\n- Multiply it with `product` and update `product`.\n- After the loop, output `product`.\n\nIn Midio, I can implement this using `Std.For` for iteration and `List.Contains` to check for existence.\n\nSince `List.Contains` isn't directly available, I might need to use `Iteration.Map` to create a contains function.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use `Sets.Difference` to get unique elements by comparing the input list with itself, but that might not directly give me the unique elements.\n\nAlternatively, I can accept that managing uniqueness is complex with the given functions and proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list, accepting the performance hit.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the plan of using a seen list and checking for existence in each iteration.\n\nHere's how it would look in Midio:\n\n- Create a function `is_in_list` that checks if an element is in a list.\n- Use `Std.For` to iterate through the input list, using `is_in_list` to check for uniqueness and accumulating the product.\n\nBut creating a separate function for `is_in_list` might be overkill. Maybe I can inline the contains check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use `Iteration.Map` to create a list of booleans indicating whether each element is unique, but this seems unnecessary.\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll simplify the approach:\n\n- Assume that the input list has no duplicates. This way, I can directly calculate the product without worrying about uniqueness.\n\nHowever, this doesn't satisfy the requirement of considering only unique numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can sort the list and then multiply consecutive unique elements.\n\nBut sorting isn't directly available, and implementing it would be too time-consuming.\n\nGiven this, I'll proceed with the initial plan of using a seen list to track uniqueness.\n\nHere's a rough sketch of the Midio code:\n\n- Check if input list is empty. If yes, output 1.\n- Else, initialize `product` to 1 and `seen` as an empty list.\n- Iterate through each element in the input list:\n- Check if the element is not in `seen`.\n- If not in `seen`, multiply it with `product` and add it to `seen`.\n- Output `product` after the loop.\n\nIn Midio, this would involve"

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3.

Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="

                "I'm trying to create a function that calculates the product of unique numbers in a given list. To achieve this, I need to first identify the unique numbers in the list and then compute their product.\n\nHere's how I plan to approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: I need a way to filter out duplicate numbers from the list. In programming, sets are commonly used for this purpose because they automatically handle uniqueness.\n\n2. **Calculate Product**: Once I have the unique numbers, I can iterate through them and calculate their product.\n\nI'll need to make sure that the function handles various cases, such as an empty list or a list with only one element.\n\nLet's think about potential edge cases:\n\n- If the list is empty, the product should be 1 (since it's the multiplicative identity).\n\n- If the list has only one unique number, the product should be that number itself.\n\n- If the list has multiple duplicates, the function should only consider one instance of each number for the product.\n\nI should also consider the data types: assuming the list contains numbers, but I'll need to ensure that the function handles integers and floats appropriately.\n\nNow, let's sketch a rough outline in code:\n\n```\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    product = 1\n    for num in unique_numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product\n```\n\nThis seems straightforward. But I need to think about potential issues:\n\n- What if the list contains zero? Multiplying by zero will result in zero, which is mathematically correct.\n\n- What if the list contains negative numbers? The product should handle negative numbers appropriately.\n\n- Performance: For very large lists, using a set might be efficient enough, but I need to consider the constraints of the system.\n\nI should also write some test cases to verify the function:\n\n1. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` should return `120` (1*2*3*4*5 = 120)\n\n2. `product_of_unique_numbers([1, 1, 1, 1])` should return `1` (only one unique number, which is 1)\n\n3. `product_of_unique_numbers([0, 1, 2, 3])` should return `0` (since 0 is in the list)\n\n4. `product_of_unique_numbers([])` should return `1` (empty list)\n\n5. `product_of_unique_numbers([-1, -2, 3])` should return `6` ((-1)*(-2)*3 = 6)\n\nLet me test these cases mentally:\n\n1. Unique numbers: 1,2,3,4,5; product: 120. Correct.\n\n2. Unique number: 1; product: 1. Correct.\n\n3. Unique numbers: 0,1,2,3; product: 0. Correct.\n\n4. No unique numbers; product: 1. Correct.\n\n5. Unique numbers: -1,-2,3; product: 6. Correct.\n\nSeems like the function should work as expected.\n\nI should also consider if there's a more Pythonic way to do this. For example, using the `math.prod` function for calculating the product, which is available in Python 3.8 and later.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis is cleaner and more concise. However, I should note that `math.prod` returns 1 for an empty iterable, which aligns with our earlier decision.\n\nIf I were to implement this in versions of Python prior to 3.8, I could use the `numpy.prod` function or implement the product using a reduce function from the `functools` module.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return np.prod(list(unique_numbers))\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nimport operator\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst):\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return reduce(operator.mul, unique_numbers, 1)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives achieve the same result.\n\nI need to decide which approach to take based on the environment and constraints. Since `math.prod` is part of the standard library in recent Python versions, it's a good choice for clarity and simplicity.\n\nFinally, I should consider type hinting to make the function more readable and maintainable:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[float]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis specifies that the function takes a list of floats and returns a float. However, if the list can contain integers as well, I can use `Union[int, float]` for better type accuracy.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n```\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef product_of_unique_numbers(lst: List[Union[int, float]]) -> float:\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    return math.prod(unique_numbers)\n```\n\nThis ensures that the function can handle both integers and floats, and the product is returned as a float, which is more general.\n\nIn summary, the function to calculate the product of unique numbers in a list can be efficiently implemented using a set to remove duplicates and then using the `math.prod` function to compute the product. This approach is efficient, concise, and handles various edge cases appropriately."

                "I'm going to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements between two lists. So, given two lists, I need to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in one list but not in the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say List A and List B, the dissimilar elements would be the elements that are in A but not in B, combined with the elements that are in B but not in A. This is essentially the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nIn set theory, the symmetric difference of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in their intersection. So, it's (A \u222a B) - (A \u2229 B).\n\nGiven that Midio seems to have set operations, I should look for a way to compute the symmetric difference using available nodes.\n\nLooking at the list of external functions provided, I see a node called \"Sets.Difference\" which returns the difference between two lists, i.e., elements in the first list that are not in the second list.\n\nTo get the symmetric difference, I can compute the difference between the first and second list, and then the difference between the second and first list, and then combine these two results into a single list.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the difference between List A and List B.\n\n2. Compute the difference between List B and List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI also need to consider if the lists can contain duplicate elements. If duplicates are possible, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists can contain duplicates, and that the dissimilar elements should preserve duplicates.\n\nFor example, if List A is [1, 2, 2, 3] and List B is [2, 3, 4], then the dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 4], preserving the duplicate '2' in List A.\n\nHowever, implementing this directly might be tricky because the \"Sets.Difference\" node might not handle duplicates in the way I expect. I need to check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it treats duplicates.\n\nAssuming that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates, I can proceed with the plan above.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, I might need to find another approach.\n\nAnother approach is to iterate through each list and collect elements that are not present in the other list, preserving duplicates.\n\nThis might involve checking for the presence of each element in the other list and collecting those that are not found.\n\nGiven that Midio has iteration and filtering capabilities, I can use the \"Iteration.Filter\" node to filter out elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nSo, for List A, filter elements that are not in List B, and vice versa, then concatenate the results.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take List A and List B as inputs.\n\n2. Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List A that are not in List B.\n\n3. Use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to create a new list containing elements from List B that are not in List A.\n\n4. Concatenate these two filtered lists to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Iteration.Filter\" node can check for the presence of an element in another list.\n\nLooking at the available nodes, there is a \"List.Contains\" node which can be used to check if an element is present in a list.\n\nSo, I can use \"List.Contains\" within the filter condition.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions again, I don't see a \"List.Contains\" node explicitly listed. I need to confirm if such a node exists or if there's another way to check for containment.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a combination of nodes to achieve this.\n\nAnother idea is to use the \"Sets.Difference\" node as mentioned earlier, assuming it handles duplicates appropriately.\n\nGiven that \"Sets.Difference\" is available, I'll proceed with that approach for simplicity.\n\nSo, I'll assume that \"Sets.Difference\" preserves duplicates when computing the difference between two lists.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Compute difference of A minus B.\n\n- Compute difference of B minus A.\n\n- Concatenate these two differences to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nI need to make sure that the concatenation preserves the order of elements or if order matters in this context.\n\nFor now, I'll assume that the order is not important, and simply concatenate the two lists.\n\nLet me sketch this in Midio terms:\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for A - B.\n\n- Instance of \"Sets.Difference\" for B - A.\n\n- Instance of \"List.Concat\" to combine the two differences.\n\nWait, scanning the list of external functions, I see \"List.GenerateRange\", \"Math.Add\", etc., but I don't see a \"List.Contains\" or a direct \"Sets.Difference\". Maybe I need to look again.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions provided:\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.For\n\n- Std_k98ojb.List.GenerateRange\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Add\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Mul\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Math.Expression\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Iteration.Map\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Logic.And\n\n- Std_k98ojb.Std.If\n\n- Http_q7o96c.http_get\n\nI don't see a \"Sets.Difference\" node in the list provided. Maybe I misread earlier.\n\nGiven that, I need to find another way to compute the difference between two lists.\n\nOne approach is to iterate through one list and filter out elements that are present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I might need to iterate through the second list and check for equality.\n\nThis could be inefficient for large lists, but since Midio is a visual programming language, efficiency might not be the primary concern here.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nHere's how I can implement it:\n\n1. For List A, filter elements that are not present in List B.\n\n2. For List B, filter elements that are not present in List A.\n\n3. Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nTo implement the filter condition, I'll need to:\n\n- For each element in List A, check if it is not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, for each element in List B, check if it is not present in List A.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if any element matches.\n\nSince Midio has iteration capabilities, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" combined with a sub-function that checks for presence.\n\nLooking at the nodes available, I see \"Iteration.Filter\", which allows filtering elements based on a condition.\n\nI need to create a condition that checks if an element is not present in the other list.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can iterate through the other list and see if there's any match.\n\nIf there's at least one match, then the element is present; otherwise, it's not.\n\nSo, for each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\nIf no matches are found, include the element in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, do the same for List B.\n\nThen, concatenate the two filtered lists to get the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but it might be inefficient for large lists because it involves nested iterations.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a visual programming language, and assuming that the lists are not extremely large, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me proceed to outline this in more detail.\n\nFirst, create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of dissimilar elements.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List A: for each element in List A, check if it's not present in List B.\n\n- Similarly, use another \"Iteration.Filter\" to filter List B: for each element in List B, check if it's not present in List A.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists to get the final result.\n\nNow, focusing on how to implement the presence check within \"Iteration.Filter\".\n\nFor example, for filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A, iterate through List B and check for equality with each element in List B.\n\n- If none of the elements in List B match the current element from List A, include it in the filtered list.\n\nSimilarly, for filtering List B.\n\nTo implement this, I might need to use \"Iteration.Any\" or a similar node that can check if any element in List B matches the current element from List A.\n\nScanning the list of external functions again, I don't see an \"Iteration.Any\" node.\n\nAlternatively, I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" on List B with a condition that checks equality with the current element from List A, and then check if the filtered list is empty.\n\nIf the filtered list is empty, it means no elements in List B match the current element from List A, so include it in the dissimilar elements.\n\nThis seems a bit convoluted, but it should work.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFor filtering List A:\n\n- For each element in List A:\n\n- Filter List B for elements equal to the current element from List A.\n\n- If the filtered list"

                "I'm going to attempt to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. I need to think about how to achieve this using the available external functions in Midio.\n\nFirst, understanding what it means to rotate a list to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, if I have a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and I want to rotate it by 2 positions to the right, the new list should be [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]. Essentially, the last 2 elements are moved to the front of the list.\n\nI need to find a way to achieve this using the provided external functions. Looking at the list manipulation functions, there's List.Slice, which can get a slice of the list from a start index to an end index. There's also List.Concat, which can concatenate two lists.\n\nSo, one approach could be:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate, let's call it 'k'.\n\n2. Calculate the split point: the index from which to start taking elements to move to the front. This would be the length of the list minus k.\n\n3. Use List.Slice to get the slice from the split point to the end of the list.\n\n4. Use List.Slice again to get the slice from the start of the list to the split point.\n\n5. Concatenate the two slices, with the second slice (end part) coming first, followed by the first slice (start part).\n\nI need to handle cases where k is greater than the length of the list or negative. To handle that, I can take k modulo the length of the list to get the effective rotation amount.\n\nAlso, if the list is empty or k is 0, the list should remain unchanged.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the effective rotation:\n\n- Get the length of the list.\n\n- Compute k modulo the length to handle cases where k is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, determine the split point:\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\nNext, slice the list from split_point to end: right_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = split_point, end = -1 (which means till the end)\n\nThen, slice the list from start to split_point: left_part\n\n- Use List.Slice with start = 0, end = split_point\n\nFinally, concatenate right_part and left_part.\n\nI need to make sure that if k is 0 or the list is empty, the original list is returned without any changes.\n\nAlso, if k is negative, I should handle it by taking the modulo as well, but since rotation is to the right, negative k would imply rotation to the left, which might not be required based on the task description. However, to handle negative k, I can convert it to a positive rotation by adding the length and then taking modulo.\n\nWait, but the task specifies rotation to the right by a specified number of items, and the specified number is presumably positive. So, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nBut to make the function more robust, I can handle negative k by converting it to positive rotation equivalent.\n\nAnyway, for now, I'll assume k is non-negative.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Function rotate_right(list: List[Any], k: Int) -> List[Any]\n\n- If list is empty or k is 0, return list\n\n- length = len(list)\n\n- effective_k = k % length\n\n- if effective_k == 0, return list\n\n- split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- right_part = list[split_point:]\n\n- left_part = list[:split_point]\n\n- return right_part + left_part\n\nNow, translating this to Midio using the available external functions.\n\nI need to find nodes for:\n\n- Getting the length of the list: List.Length\n\n- Computing modulo: Math.Mod\n\n- Slicing the list: List.Slice\n\n- Concatenating lists: List.Concat\n\nI need to set up the function with inputs for the list and k, and output the rotated list.\n\nI should also handle cases where k is greater than the list length, which is why computing effective_k is important.\n\nLet me consider an example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=2\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = list[3:] = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = list[:3] = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5] + [1,2,3] = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=7\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 2 = 3\n\nright_part = [4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2,3]\n\nrotated_list = [4,5,1,2,3]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 0 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [], k=2\n\nLength = 0\n\neffective_k = 2 % 0 -> division by zero? Need to handle empty list.\n\nWait, modulo with length 0 would cause issues. So, need to handle empty list separately.\n\nIn code, I should check if the list is empty, and if so, return it immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if k is 0, return the original list.\n\nOkay, now thinking in terms of Midio nodes:\n\n- Start with inputs: list and k\n\n- Check if list is empty: use List.Length and compare to 0\n\n- If empty, output the list\n\n- Check if k is 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed to compute effective_k = k % length\n\n- Compute split_point = length - effective_k\n\n- Use List.Slice to get right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\n- Use List.Slice to get left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate right_part and left_part\n\n- Output the result\n\nI need to make sure that the nodes are connected properly with triggers and properties.\n\nAlso, need to handle cases where k is negative. For now, I'll assume k is non-negative, but it's good to think about it.\n\nIf k is negative, rotating to the right by a negative number would be equivalent to rotating to the left by the absolute value. But since the task specifies rotation to the right, and k is presumably positive, I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio terms.\n\nAssuming I have input nodes for list and k, and output node for the rotated list.\n\nI need computational nodes for:\n\n- List.Length\n\n- Math.Mod (for effective_k)\n\n- Math.Sub (for split_point = length - effective_k)\n\n- List.Slice (twice: once for right_part and once for left_part)\n\n- List.Concat\n\nI need to connect the outputs of these nodes appropriately.\n\nAlso, I need conditionals to handle the cases where the list is empty or k is 0.\n\nSo, perhaps using Std.If nodes to check conditions and decide which path to take.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Check if list is empty: if length == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, check if k == 0, output the list\n\n- Else, proceed with rotation\n\nThis can be implemented using nested Std.If nodes.\n\nAlternatively, use a combination of Logic.Equal and Std.If to handle these cases.\n\nI need to make sure that the triggers are properly propagated through the graph.\n\nLet me try to outline the node connections:\n\n1. List.Length connected to get the length of the list\n\n2. Math.Equal to check if length == 0\n\n3. Std.If: if length == 0, output the original list; else, proceed\n\n4. In the else branch:\n\na. Math.Equal to check if k == 0\n\nb. Std.If: if k == 0, output the original list; else, proceed with rotation\n\n5. In the rotation path:\n\na. Math.Mod: effective_k = k % length\n\nb. Math.Sub: split_point = length - effective_k\n\nc. List.Slice for right_part: start=split_point, end=-1\n\nd. List.Slice for left_part: start=0, end=split_point\n\ne. List.Concat: right_part + left_part\n\nf. Output the concatenated list\n\nI need to ensure that all these operations are triggered appropriately when the input list and k change.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that negative k is handled correctly, but as assumed, k is non-negative.\n\nI should also consider if k is larger than the list length; the modulo operation should handle this by effectively rotating by k % length.\n\nLet me think about another example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 5 % 5 = 0\n\nReturn original list\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=3\n\nLength = 5\n\neffective_k = 3 % 5 = 3\n\nsplit_point = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nright_part = [3,4,5]\n\nleft_part = [1,2]\n\nrotated_list ="
