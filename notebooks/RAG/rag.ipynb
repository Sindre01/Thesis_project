      "## Functions  \n",
      "Functions in Midio provide a way to group reusable flows together. By defining a function, you can encapsulate a specific behavior or operation that can be invoked multiple times throughout your program. Functions can have both inputs and outputs in the form of triggers and properties, allowing them to accept data, process it, and produce results. Unlike modules, functions cannot contain events.\n",

      "# The Midio Language  \n",
      "Midio is a visual, general-purpose programming language. Its building blocks, composed of functions and events, are similar to those found in standard textual languages. Functions are entities that process input and produce output. Events, on the other hand, enable triggering of flows based on specific conditions such as incoming HTTP requests. Midio also includes data types and modules for organizing the code.  \n",
      "The term **node** is used to describe instances of both functions and events, which are visually represented as nodes connected by **arrows** to form flows. Both functions and modules can contain **flows**, but only modules can utilize event nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ðŸ“„ the-midio-language.md (Chunk ID: 9)\n",
      "## Data node  \n",
      "Data nodes can be used to create both primitive values and complex data structures easily. You can add one by pressing space, and searching for `data object`, `string`, `number` and so on, or just paste a string into the search bar and press enter to get a string object. You can also paste JSON data from the clipboard directly onto the node graph, and it will import it as a data node.  \n",
      "Data nodes are connected by the socket in their top-right corner, and can be used as input to any function.  \n",
      "Data nodes can also depend on other data nodes or the result of function calls, by converting a field to an input field. This can be done by clicking the input icon which appear when hovering a field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ðŸ“„ the-midio-language.md (Chunk ID: 5)\n",
      "## Modules  \n",
      "Modules in Midio serve as an organizational tool for structuring your code, separating different parts of the program into distinct and manageable units.  \n",
      "A module can contain other modules, function definitions, and type definitions, allowing for a hierarchical organization of your program. In addition to these structural elements, modules can also contain flows.  \n",
      "Modules can also have instances of events, which is not possible inside functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ðŸ“„ overview.md (Chunk ID: 2)\n",
      "## Nodes  \n",
      "Function instances that have input or output triggers also get a play-button in their header, which can be clicked to execute a flow starting from that node.\n",

      "\n",
      "ðŸ“„ the-midio-language.md (Chunk ID: 3)\n",
      "## Data types  \n",
      "Midio supports a variety of data types that allow you to work with different kinds of information. These data types include:  \n",
      "* **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point values.\n",
      "* **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.\n",
      "* **Boolean**: Represents a true or false value.\n",
      "* **Null**: Represents a lack of value\n",
      "* **Array**: Represents an ordered collection of elements, which can be of any data type.\n",
      "* **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be of any data type.\n",
      "* **Buffer**: An efficient representation of binary data as a sequence of bytes.\n",
      "* **Opaque**: A type used to hide a native value, used by certain native functions to manage native data types.\n",

      "ðŸ“„ overview.md (Chunk ID: 0)\n",
      "# Overview  \n",
      "## Project overview  \n",
      "The project overview panel lists all the module, function and type definitions in the current project. They can be clicked to navigate the node editor to edit that definition.  \n",
      "To remove a definition, simply hover over the desired item, and a trash bin icon will appear. Click on this icon to delete the definition. Additionally, when hovering over module definitions, a plus icon will become visible. This icon allows you to add extra modules, types, or functions within the specified module.  \n",

      "## Debugging  \n",
      "Step debugging is a helpful way for you to examine your code as it runs. By pausing the code at certain points and going through it step by step, you can see how things change and find problems.  \n",
      "You have the ability to set breakpoints by simply right-clicking on nodes and selecting \"toggle breakpoint.\" When the execution reaches that node, it will pause (indicated by a blue outline). With the buttons in the process panel, you can step to the next node or continue the execution. If multiple processes are paused simultaneously, you can easily switch between them by clicking on their respective entries in the process panel.\n",

      "### External functions  \n",
      "External functions in Midio are functions with a native implementation in Rust. These functions generally provide better performance and access to lower-level system features compared to functions written directly in Midio. Most of the functions in the Midio standard library are external functions, which form a foundation of useful and efficient building blocks for your programs.  \n",
