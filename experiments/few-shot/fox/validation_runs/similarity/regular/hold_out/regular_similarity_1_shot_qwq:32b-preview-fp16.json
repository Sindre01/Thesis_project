                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that determines if two integers have opposite signs. In programming, the sign of an integer can be determined by checking if it's positive or negative. Zero is considered neither positive nor negative, so I need to handle that case as well.\n\nOne way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to multiply them and see if the result is negative. If the product is negative, then one is positive and the other is negative. However, this approach might not work if one or both of the numbers are zero, since zero multiplied by any number is zero, which is neither positive nor negative.\n\nAnother approach is to check the sign of each number individually and see if they differ. In most programming languages, including Midio, you can use the greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`) operators to determine the sign of a number. Specifically:\n\n- If a number is greater than zero, it's positive.\n\n- If a number is less than zero, it's negative.\n\n- If a number is equal to zero, it's neither positive nor negative.\n\nSo, for two numbers `a` and `b`, if one is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. If both are positive or both are negative, they have the same sign. If either or both are zero, they don't have opposite signs.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio. Let's think about how to structure this function.\n\nFirst, I'll define a function that takes two integer inputs, say `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean indicating whether they have opposite signs.\n\nI can use conditional nodes to check the signs of both numbers and then compare them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Check if `a` is greater than zero.\n\n2. Check if `b` is greater than zero.\n\n3. If one is greater than zero and the other is not, then they have opposite signs.\n\n4. However, I need to consider the case when one or both are zero. Zero should not be considered as having an opposite sign with any number, including itself.\n\nSo, I need to adjust the logic to handle zeros appropriately.\n\nPerhaps a better way is:\n\n- If `a` is positive and `b` is negative, or if `a` is negative and `b` is positive, then they have opposite signs.\n\n- If both are positive, both are negative, or either is zero, they do not have opposite signs.\n\nIn code, this can be represented using logical operators.\n\nLet me try to write this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to use comparison nodes to check the signs and logical nodes to combine the results.\n\nAlso, I should consider the possibility of overflow if I were to multiply the numbers, but since I'm not multiplying them, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nLet me sketch this out.\n\nAssume I have two input integers, `a` and `b`.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A node to check if `a > 0`\n\n- A node to check if `b > 0`\n\nThen, I can use these results to determine if they have opposite signs.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If `a > 0` is true and `b > 0` is false, or if `a > 0` is false and `b > 0` is true, then they have opposite signs.\n\nIn other words, the XOR (exclusive or) of `(a > 0)` and `(b > 0)`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to perform this operation.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- Two greater-than nodes for `a > 0` and `b > 0`\n\n- An XOR node to combine their results\n\n- Finally, output the result of the XOR as the function's output\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that if either `a` or `b` is zero, the function correctly returns false, since zero doesn't have an opposite sign.\n\nGiven that zero is neither greater than nor less than zero, the checks should naturally handle zeros correctly.\n\nLet me verify this:\n\n- If `a` is zero and `b` is positive: `a > 0` is false, `b > 0` is true \u2192 XOR is true, but zero shouldn't be considered as having an opposite sign.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, my initial approach has a flaw.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that neither `a` nor `b` is zero when considering them to have opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, I need to add checks for `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nSo, the complete logic should be:\n\n- If `a` is not zero and `b` is not zero and their signs are different, then return true.\n\n- Otherwise, return false.\n\nIn terms of nodes:\n\n- Check if `a > 0`\n\n- Check if `b > 0`\n\n- XOR these two results to see if they have different signs\n\n- Check if `a != 0`\n\n- Check if `b != 0`\n\n- Combine these with logical AND to ensure neither is zero and their signs are different.\n\nSo, the final output is `(a > 0) xor (b > 0)` and `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nWait, actually, since `a != 0` is equivalent to `a > 0 or a < 0`, and similarly for `b`.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can first check if both are not zero, and then check if their signs are different.\n\nIn code, that would be:\n\n`(a != 0) and (b != 0) and ((a > 0) != (b > 0))`\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this using comparison nodes and logic gates.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. Node to check `a != 0`\n\n2. Node to check `b != 0`\n\n3. Node to check `a > 0`\n\n4. Node to check `b > 0`\n\n5. Node to compute `(a > 0) != (b > 0)` (XOR)\n\n6. Node to compute `(a != 0) and (b != 0) and XOR`\n\nThen, output the result of this combined logic.\n\nI need to make sure that the XOR is correctly implemented. In Midio, there might be an XOR node, or I can use a combination of logical operators to achieve the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the expression node to write a simple expression that checks for opposite signs.\n\nIn many programming languages, a quick way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to use the condition `(a ^ b) < 0`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. However, I'm not sure if Midio supports bitwise operations, so I'll stick with comparison and logical operators.\n\nLet me consider writing an expression for the condition.\n\nSomething like:\n\n`(a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0)`\n\nThis expression directly checks if one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nAnd to handle zeros correctly, since zero is neither positive nor negative, the expression already excludes zeros because zero doesn't satisfy `a > 0` or `a < 0`.\n\nTherefore, if either `a` or `b` is zero, the expression will evaluate to false, which is the desired behavior.\n\nSo, using this expression seems straightforward and correct.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to build this expression.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio has a built-in function for checking signs, I could use that, but assuming it doesn't, I'll proceed with the above approach.\n\nLet me sketch this out in terms of nodes:\n\n- Compare `a > 0`\n\n- Compare `b < 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Compare `a < 0`\n\n- Compare `b > 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Or the two And results\n\nThis will give me the desired output.\n\nLet me confirm with some examples:\n\n1. a = 5, b = -3\n\n- a > 0: true\n\n- b < 0: true\n\n- first And: true\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n2. a = -2, b = 4\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: true\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n3. a = 0, b = 5\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n4. a = -3, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n5. a = 0, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n6. a = 3, b ="

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is divisible by 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to implement this logic using the available nodes in Midio. Let's see what nodes I can use:\n\n- **Strings** nodes to handle the conversion of the number to a string and accessing individual characters.\n- **Math** nodes for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n- **Iteration** nodes to loop through each digit.\n- **Logic** nodes to check if the final difference is divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the input number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToLower` node, but since it converts to lowercase, which isn't necessary for digits, maybe there's a better way. Actually, I think there might be a `ToString` function or something similar, but since it's not listed, perhaps I need to assume that the input is already a string or find another way.\n\nWait, looking back at the list of external functions, there's no direct `ToString` function. So, I'll assume the input is provided as a string representing the number.\n\nNext, I need to iterate through each character in the string, convert each character to a digit, and then apply the alternating addition and subtraction.\n\nI can use the `Strings.Characters` node to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, I'll use the `Iteration.Map` node to process each character in the list. In the map function, I'll convert each character to a number.\n\nAfter that, I need to calculate the alternating sum. For this, I might need to keep track of whether the current digit is in an odd or even position. I can use the index provided by the `Iteration.Map` node to determine the position.\n\nIn the map function, if the index is even, add the digit to one sum; if odd, subtract it from another sum.\n\nWait, actually, to simplify, I can calculate a single sum where I alternate between adding and subtracting based on the position.\n\nFinally, check if this sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to convert each character to a number and apply the alternating sign based on its position.\n4. Sum all the results from the map function.\n5. Check if the sum is divisible by 11 using the `Math.Mod` node and see if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but in the standard divisibility rule for 11, it's the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions that should be divisible by 11.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to calculate two separate sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions, then compute their difference, and check if that difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis might be more accurate to the standard rule.\n\nTherefore, I'll adjust my plan:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to process each character:\n   - Convert the character to a number.\n   - Based on the index, add to sum1 if odd position, add to sum2 if even position.\n4. Calculate the difference between sum1 and sum2.\n5. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but in the standard rule, it's sum of digits in odd positions minus sum of digits in even positions.\n\nI need to make sure I'm consistent with that.\n\nLet me try to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, get the list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to create a new list where each element is the digit value with the appropriate sign based on its position.\n\nFor example, for number 121:\n\n- Positions: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 1 (odd)\n\n- Sum1 (odd positions): 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum2 (even positions): 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: 123456789\n\n- Positions: 1(odd), 2(even), 3(odd), 4(even), 5(odd), 6(even), 7(odd), 8(even), 9(odd)\n\n- Sum1: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum2: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in the map function, I need to:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Based on index (starting from 0):\n\n- If index is even, add the digit to sum1.\n\n- If index is odd, add the digit to sum2.\n\nThen, compute sum1 - sum2 and check divisibility by 11.\n\nAlternatively, I can have two separate sums and accumulate them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps using `Iteration.Map` to create a list where each element is either added or subtracted based on its position, then summing the list.\n\nWait, that could work too.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSo, in the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- If index is even, keep the digit as is.\n\n- If index is odd, negate the digit.\n\nThen, sum all elements of the list. If the sum is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me verify with the earlier examples.\n\nFor 121:\n\n- Digits: 1 (even position, positive), 2 (odd position, negative), 1 (even position, positive)\n\n- Sum: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = (1+3+5+7+9) - (2+4+6+8) = 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother test: 11.\n\n- Digits: 1 (even) -1 (odd) = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 22.\n\n- Digits: 2 (even) -2 (odd) = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 121.\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1331.\n\n- Digits: 1 -3 +3 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1001.\n\n- Digits: 1 -0 +0 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 726.\n\n- Digits: 7 -2 +6 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to create a function that takes an input string representing the number.\n\nThen, use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to process each character with its index.\n\nIn the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Check if index is even or odd.\n\n- If even, keep the number as is.\n\n- If odd, negate the number.\n\nAfter mapping, sum all elements of the list using `Iteration.Reduce`.\n\nThen, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using `Math.Mod` and see if the result is zero.\n\nIf yes, output true; else, false.\n\nI need to make sure that the input is a string and that it consists only of digits. If there are non-digit characters, the function should probably handle them appropriately, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the input is a valid string of digits.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the number is negative. According to the rules, the sign doesn't matter for divisibility by 11, so I can ignore the minus sign if present.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial task, it's about a \"number,\" but in my approach, I'm treating it as a string. To make it more flexible, perhaps I should accept a number input and convert it to a string.\n\nBut looking back at the available nodes, there's no direct way to convert a number to a string. So, I'll assume the input is a string."

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI'll need to use some Midio nodes to achieve this:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n- Iterate through each character (digit) in the string.\n- Determine if the position is odd or even.\n- Perform addition or subtraction accordingly.\n- Check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's start by sketching out the steps in Midio nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToString` node for this, but I notice it's not in the provided list. Maybe there's another way to get the string representation of a number.\n\nLooking at the provided external functions, I see `Strings.Characters`, which can give me a list of characters from a string. So, perhaps I can pass the number as a string directly or find a way to convert it.\n\nWait, actually, I see `Strings.Contains`, `Strings.IsNumeric`, etc., but no direct conversion from number to string. Maybe I need to create a custom function for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to handle numbers directly without converting them to strings. For example, by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and taking modulo to get each digit.\n\nThat might be more efficient and align better with the available nodes.\n\nSo, here's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n2. Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.\n3. Determine the position by counting from the right or left. For simplicity, let's consider the rightmost digit as position 1 (odd).\n4. While the number is greater than 0:\n   a. Take the last digit using modulo 10.\n   b. Determine if the current position is odd or even.\n   c. Add or subtract the digit from the appropriate sum.\n   d. Remove the last digit by integer division by 10.\n   e. Toggle the position (from odd to even, etc.).\n5. Calculate the difference between the two sums.\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis approach avoids converting the number to a string and works directly with integers, which should be more efficient.\n\nLooking at the available nodes:\n\n- `Math.Div` for division.\n- `Math.Mod` for modulo operation.\n- `Math.Add` and `Math.Sub` for addition and subtraction.\n- `Logic.And`, `Logic.Or`, etc., for combining conditions.\n- `Std.If` for conditional execution.\n- `Std.For` for looping.\n\nI think I can implement this logic using a loop, likely a `Std.For` loop, where I iterate through each digit by repeatedly dividing the number by 10.\n\nHowever, `Std.For` typically requires a list or a range, but here I need to loop until the number becomes 0. Maybe I need to use a different approach, like recursion or a while-loop equivalent in Midio.\n\nUpon checking, I see that Midio supports recursive functions, so I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and accumulates the sums accordingly.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, let's see if I can use an iterative approach with a `Std.For` loop by estimating the number of digits in the number and looping that many times.\n\nTo estimate the number of digits, I can use logarithms, but since Midio might not have log functions, another way is to convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, I'm back to the conversion issue.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop while the number is greater than 0, processing one digit per iteration, and use a counter to keep track of the position (odd or even).\n\nBut since Midio's `Std.For` seems to require a predefined range, maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a `Std.While` node for this purpose, but scanning the provided nodes, I don't see a `Std.While`. It seems like `Std.For` is the primary looping construct available.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to work with `Std.For`. To use `Std.For`, I need to generate a range that corresponds to the number of digits in the input number.\n\nTo get the number of digits, I can use a loop that counts how many times I can divide the number by 10 before it becomes 0. But again, this requires some form of looping, which brings us back to the same issue.\n\nMaybe I can create a fixed-length loop that assumes a maximum number of digits, say 20, which should cover most practical cases.\n\nBut that seems inefficient and not elegant. There must be a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can generate a list of digits by repeatedly taking the last digit and dividing the number by 10, building a list as I go.\n\nThen, I can use `Std.Iteration.Map` to process each digit with its position.\n\nBut looking back at the provided nodes, I see `List.GenerateRange`, but that generates a range of numbers, not a list of digits.\n\nI need to create a list of digits from the input number.\n\nLet me think differently: I can create a loop that extracts each digit and builds a list, then use that list in a `Std.For` loop.\n\nBut this seems complicated without a direct way to build lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use recursion to process each digit one by one, passing along the accumulated sums and the current position.\n\nSince Midio supports recursive functions, this might be a viable approach.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Create a recursive function that takes the number, current odd sum, current even sum, and the current position (odd or even).\n- In each recursion, process the last digit based on the current position.\n- Update the sums accordingly.\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n- Toggle the position.\n- Base case: when the number becomes 0, calculate the difference between the sums and check if it's divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code-like terms:\n\nfunc is_divisible_by_11(n: Number) -> Bool {\n\n    func helper(num: Number, odd_sum: Number, even_sum: Number, is_odd: Bool) -> Bool {\n\n        if num == 0 {\n\n            return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0\n\n        } else {\n\n            digit = num % 10\n\n            if is_odd {\n\n                odd_sum += digit\n\n            } else {\n\n                even_sum += digit\n\n            }\n\n            return helper(num \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return helper(n, 0, 0, true)\n\n}\n\nThis is a recursive approach in pseudocode. Now, I need to translate this into Midio nodes.\n\nIn Midio, recursive functions can be created by having a function call itself. So, I'll define a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function recursively.\n\nI'll need to manage the state across recursive calls, i.e., the remaining number, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nIn Midio, functions can have properties that retain their values between calls, but I need to ensure that each recursion has its own set of variables.\n\nAlternatively, I can pass these values as parameters in each recursive call.\n\nGiven that, I'll define the helper function with parameters for num, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are nodes, and parameters are input properties.\n\nSo, I'll create a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function with initial parameters, and the helper function calls itself recursively.\n\nI need to make sure that the recursion terminates when num becomes 0.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.If` to check if num is 0, and either return the result or proceed with the next recursive call.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio:\n\n1. Main function `is_divisible_by_11`:\n\n- Takes input property `n: Number`.\n\n- Calls helper function with `num = n`, `odd_sum = 0`, `even_sum = 0`, `is_odd = true`.\n\n- Returns the result from the helper function.\n\n2. Helper function:\n\n- Takes input properties: `num: Number`, `odd_sum: Number`, `even_sum: Number`, `is_odd: Bool`.\n\n- If `num == 0`:\n\n- Calculate difference: `odd_sum - even_sum`.\n\n- Check if difference % 11 == 0.\n\n- Return true if yes, else false.\n\n- Else:\n\n- digit = num % 10.\n\n- If `is_odd`:\n\n- odd_sum += digit.\n\n- Else:\n\n- even_sum += digit.\n\n- Call helper with `num \n\n- Return the result of the"

                "I need to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, essentially, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are only in A and those that are only in B. In set theory terms, this is the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nSo, my function should take two lists as input and return a list containing elements that are unique to each list.\n\nLet me consider an example to clarify:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nList B: [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 5, 6] because 1 and 2 are only in A, and 5 and 6 are only in B.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations. In Midio, there might be functions or nodes that allow me to perform set differences.\n\nI recall that there is a \"Sets.Difference\" node which can compute the difference between two lists. So, if I compute the difference of A minus B and B minus A, and then combine those two differences, I should get the symmetric difference, which is what I need.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the difference of list A minus list B.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list B minus list A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists may contain duplicates, and I want to preserve them in the output.\n\nWait, but set operations typically deal with unique elements. If I use set-based nodes, duplicates might be removed. I need to ensure that duplicates are handled appropriately.\n\nLet me check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it handles duplicates.\n\nAssuming \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, which is typical for set operations, then I need to find a way to handle duplicates as per the requirements.\n\nIf duplicates are allowed and need to be preserved, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Iterate through list A and collect elements not present in list B.\n\n- Iterate through list B and collect elements not present in list A.\n\n- Combine these two collections to get the final list.\n\nThis way, duplicates in the original lists will be preserved in the output.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I need a way to iterate through list A and check for each element if it's present in list B.\n\nSimilarly, iterate through list B and check for each element if it's present in list A.\n\nThen, collect those elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nFinally, combine these two collections.\n\nIn Midio, I can use iteration nodes like \"Iteration.Map\" or \"Iteration.Filter\" to achieve this.\n\nLet me consider using \"Iteration.Filter\" for this purpose.\n\nI can create two filter instances:\n\n1. Filter list A by elements not in list B.\n\n2. Filter list B by elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can use the \"List.Contains\" node.\n\nHowever, \"List.Contains\" might not be efficient for large lists since it would involve checking each element individually.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nLet me sketch a high-level flow:\n\n- Input: list1 and list2\n\n- Filter list1 to include only elements not in list2.\n\n- Filter list2 to include only elements not in list1.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function with two input properties for the lists and one output property for the result list.\n\nInside the function, I'll set up the filter nodes as described.\n\nLet me consider how to connect the nodes.\n\nFirst, create two \"Iteration.Filter\" instances.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list2\n\nSimilarly for the second filter:\n\n- items: connected to list2\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list1\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the output lists from both filters.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenated list to the output property.\n\nNow, I need to define the handler functions for the filters.\n\nFor the first filter, the handler should check if the item is not in list2.\n\nI can create a small function that takes an item and uses \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in list2, then logically negate that.\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure these handler functions.\n\nIn Midio, functions can be created using anonymous function instances or by defining sub-functions.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll use anonymous functions for the handlers.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Filter\" accepts a function instance for the handler, I can create inline functions.\n\nWithin these inline functions, I'll use \"List.Contains\" to check membership.\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\nConnect the output of \"Logic.Not\" to the output of the handler function.\n\nAlright, let's try to visualize this.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler:\n\n    - input: item\n\n    - List.Contains(list: list2, item: item) -> contains\n\n    - Logic.Not(input: contains) -> notContains\n\n    - notContains connected to the handler's output\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nThen, List.Concat(list1_filtered, list2_filtered) -> concatenated_list\n\nconcatenated_list connected to the output property.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the data types of the elements in the lists. Assuming they are comparable, which should be the case for set operations.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Both lists are empty: should return an empty list.\n\n- One list is empty: should return the non-empty list as is.\n\n- Lists have no common elements: should return the concatenation of both lists.\n\n- Lists have some common elements: should return elements unique to each list.\n\nI need to ensure that the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nAlso, regarding duplicates:\n\n- If list1 has duplicates, and those duplicates are not in list2, they should be included in the output.\n\n- Similarly for list2.\n\nSince we're using \"List.Contains\" which likely checks for presence without considering counts, duplicates in list1 will be preserved as long as they are not present in list2.\n\nWait, but \"List.Contains\" only checks for presence, not count. So, if list1 has multiple instances of an element not in list2, all should be included in the output.\n\nSimilarly for list2.\n\nThis seems acceptable for finding dissimilar elements.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to handle duplicates based on counts, that would be more complex, but for now, I'll assume that's not required.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of elements in the output.\n\nDepending on the requirements, I might need to preserve the original order or don't care about the order.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll let the order be determined by the concatenation order.\n\nNow, time to actually create the function in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1. Define a new function in the module.\n\n2. Add two input properties for the lists.\n\n3. Add one output property for the result list.\n\n4. Add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for both lists.\n\n5. Create inline handler functions for the filters using \"List.Contains\" and \"Logic.Not\".\n\n6. Use \"List.Concat\" to combine the filtered lists.\n\n7. Connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also give meaningful names to the nodes and properties for clarity.\n\nLet me start by creating the function.\n\nIn Midio, I can right-click in the module canvas and choose \"New Function\".\n\nThen, define the input and output properties.\n\nFor the function name, perhaps \"dissimilar_elements\" or \"symmetric_difference\".\n\nI'll go with \"symmetric_difference\" to align with set theory terminology.\n\nSo, function name: symmetric_difference\n\nInputs:\n\n- list1: List\n\n- list2: List\n\nOutput:\n\n- result: List\n\nNow, add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for list1 and list2.\n\nFor each filter, create an anonymous function for the handler.\n\nWithin each handler:\n\n- Take the item input.\n\n- Use \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in the other list.\n\n- Use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\n- Connect the inverted result to the handler's output.\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the two filtered lists.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also think about performance. If the lists are large, this approach might be inefficient because for each element in list1, it checks if it's in list2, and vice versa.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this implementation, assuming that efficiency isn't a major concern.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio provides a \"Sets.SymmetricDifference\" node, I could use that directly.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a symmetric difference function available.\n\nI should check the standard library to see if such a function exists.\n\nLooking up in the \"std\" module, I find \"Sets.Symmetric"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that determines if two integers have opposite signs. In programming, the sign of an integer can be determined by checking if it's positive or negative. Zero is considered neither positive nor negative, so I need to handle that case as well.\n\nOne way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to multiply them and see if the result is negative. If the product is negative, then one is positive and the other is negative. However, this approach might not work if one or both of the numbers are zero, since zero multiplied by any number is zero, which is neither positive nor negative.\n\nAnother approach is to check the sign of each number individually and see if they differ. In most programming languages, including Midio, you can use the greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`) operators to determine the sign of a number. Specifically:\n\n- If a number is greater than zero, it's positive.\n\n- If a number is less than zero, it's negative.\n\n- If a number is equal to zero, it's neither positive nor negative.\n\nSo, for two numbers `a` and `b`, if one is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. If both are positive or both are negative, they have the same sign. If either or both are zero, they don't have opposite signs.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio. Let's think about how to structure this function.\n\nFirst, I'll define a function that takes two integer inputs, say `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean indicating whether they have opposite signs.\n\nI can use conditional nodes to check the signs of both numbers and then compare them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Check if `a` is greater than zero.\n\n2. Check if `b` is greater than zero.\n\n3. If one is greater than zero and the other is not, then they have opposite signs.\n\n4. However, I need to consider the case when one or both are zero. Zero should not be considered as having an opposite sign with any number, including itself.\n\nSo, I need to adjust the logic to handle zeros appropriately.\n\nPerhaps a better way is:\n\n- If `a` is positive and `b` is negative, or if `a` is negative and `b` is positive, then they have opposite signs.\n\n- If both are positive, both are negative, or either is zero, they do not have opposite signs.\n\nIn code, this can be represented using logical operators.\n\nLet me try to write this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to use comparison nodes to check the signs and logical nodes to combine the results.\n\nAlso, I should consider the possibility of overflow if I were to multiply the numbers, but since I'm not multiplying them, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nLet me sketch this out.\n\nAssume I have two input integers, `a` and `b`.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A node to check if `a > 0`\n\n- A node to check if `b > 0`\n\nThen, I can use these results to determine if they have opposite signs.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If `a > 0` is true and `b > 0` is false, or if `a > 0` is false and `b > 0` is true, then they have opposite signs.\n\nIn other words, the XOR (exclusive or) of `(a > 0)` and `(b > 0)`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to perform this operation.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- Two greater-than nodes for `a > 0` and `b > 0`\n\n- An XOR node to combine their results\n\n- Finally, output the result of the XOR as the function's output\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that if either `a` or `b` is zero, the function correctly returns false, since zero doesn't have an opposite sign.\n\nGiven that zero is neither greater than nor less than zero, the checks should naturally handle zeros correctly.\n\nLet me verify this:\n\n- If `a` is zero and `b` is positive: `a > 0` is false, `b > 0` is true \u2192 XOR is true, but zero shouldn't be considered as having an opposite sign.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, my initial approach has a flaw.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that neither `a` nor `b` is zero when considering them to have opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, I need to add checks for `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nSo, the complete logic should be:\n\n- If `a` is not zero and `b` is not zero and their signs are different, then return true.\n\n- Otherwise, return false.\n\nIn terms of nodes:\n\n- Check if `a > 0`\n\n- Check if `b > 0`\n\n- XOR these two results to see if they have different signs\n\n- Check if `a != 0`\n\n- Check if `b != 0`\n\n- Combine these with logical AND to ensure neither is zero and their signs are different.\n\nSo, the final output is `(a > 0) xor (b > 0)` and `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nWait, actually, since `a != 0` is equivalent to `a > 0 or a < 0`, and similarly for `b`.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can first check if both are not zero, and then check if their signs are different.\n\nIn code, that would be:\n\n`(a != 0) and (b != 0) and ((a > 0) != (b > 0))`\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this using comparison nodes and logic gates.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. Node to check `a != 0`\n\n2. Node to check `b != 0`\n\n3. Node to check `a > 0`\n\n4. Node to check `b > 0`\n\n5. Node to compute `(a > 0) != (b > 0)` (XOR)\n\n6. Node to compute `(a != 0) and (b != 0) and XOR`\n\nThen, output the result of this combined logic.\n\nI need to make sure that the XOR is correctly implemented. In Midio, there might be an XOR node, or I can use a combination of logical operators to achieve the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the expression node to write a simple expression that checks for opposite signs.\n\nIn many programming languages, a quick way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to use the condition `(a ^ b) < 0`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. However, I'm not sure if Midio supports bitwise operations, so I'll stick with comparison and logical operators.\n\nLet me consider writing an expression for the condition.\n\nSomething like:\n\n`(a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0)`\n\nThis expression directly checks if one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nAnd to handle zeros correctly, since zero is neither positive nor negative, the expression already excludes zeros because zero doesn't satisfy `a > 0` or `a < 0`.\n\nTherefore, if either `a` or `b` is zero, the expression will evaluate to false, which is the desired behavior.\n\nSo, using this expression seems straightforward and correct.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to build this expression.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio has a built-in function for checking signs, I could use that, but assuming it doesn't, I'll proceed with the above approach.\n\nLet me sketch this out in terms of nodes:\n\n- Compare `a > 0`\n\n- Compare `b < 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Compare `a < 0`\n\n- Compare `b > 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Or the two And results\n\nThis will give me the desired output.\n\nLet me confirm with some examples:\n\n1. a = 5, b = -3\n\n- a > 0: true\n\n- b < 0: true\n\n- first And: true\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n2. a = -2, b = 4\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: true\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n3. a = 0, b = 5\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n4. a = -3, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n5. a = 0, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n6. a = 3, b ="

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is divisible by 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to implement this logic using the available nodes in Midio. Let's see what nodes I can use:\n\n- **Strings** nodes to handle the conversion of the number to a string and accessing individual characters.\n- **Math** nodes for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n- **Iteration** nodes to loop through each digit.\n- **Logic** nodes to check if the final difference is divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the input number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToLower` node, but since it converts to lowercase, which isn't necessary for digits, maybe there's a better way. Actually, I think there might be a `ToString` function or something similar, but since it's not listed, perhaps I need to assume that the input is already a string or find another way.\n\nWait, looking back at the list of external functions, there's no direct `ToString` function. So, I'll assume the input is provided as a string representing the number.\n\nNext, I need to iterate through each character in the string, convert each character to a digit, and then apply the alternating addition and subtraction.\n\nI can use the `Strings.Characters` node to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, I'll use the `Iteration.Map` node to process each character in the list. In the map function, I'll convert each character to a number.\n\nAfter that, I need to calculate the alternating sum. For this, I might need to keep track of whether the current digit is in an odd or even position. I can use the index provided by the `Iteration.Map` node to determine the position.\n\nIn the map function, if the index is even, add the digit to one sum; if odd, subtract it from another sum.\n\nWait, actually, to simplify, I can calculate a single sum where I alternate between adding and subtracting based on the position.\n\nFinally, check if this sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to convert each character to a number and apply the alternating sign based on its position.\n4. Sum all the results from the map function.\n5. Check if the sum is divisible by 11 using the `Math.Mod` node and see if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but in the standard divisibility rule for 11, it's the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions that should be divisible by 11.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to calculate two separate sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions, then compute their difference, and check if that difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis might be more accurate to the standard rule.\n\nTherefore, I'll adjust my plan:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to process each character:\n   - Convert the character to a number.\n   - Based on the index, add to sum1 if odd position, add to sum2 if even position.\n4. Calculate the difference between sum1 and sum2.\n5. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but in the standard rule, it's sum of digits in odd positions minus sum of digits in even positions.\n\nI need to make sure I'm consistent with that.\n\nLet me try to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, get the list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to create a new list where each element is the digit value with the appropriate sign based on its position.\n\nFor example, for number 121:\n\n- Positions: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 1 (odd)\n\n- Sum1 (odd positions): 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum2 (even positions): 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: 123456789\n\n- Positions: 1(odd), 2(even), 3(odd), 4(even), 5(odd), 6(even), 7(odd), 8(even), 9(odd)\n\n- Sum1: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum2: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in the map function, I need to:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Based on index (starting from 0):\n\n- If index is even, add the digit to sum1.\n\n- If index is odd, add the digit to sum2.\n\nThen, compute sum1 - sum2 and check divisibility by 11.\n\nAlternatively, I can have two separate sums and accumulate them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps using `Iteration.Map` to create a list where each element is either added or subtracted based on its position, then summing the list.\n\nWait, that could work too.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSo, in the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- If index is even, keep the digit as is.\n\n- If index is odd, negate the digit.\n\nThen, sum all elements of the list. If the sum is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me verify with the earlier examples.\n\nFor 121:\n\n- Digits: 1 (even position, positive), 2 (odd position, negative), 1 (even position, positive)\n\n- Sum: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = (1+3+5+7+9) - (2+4+6+8) = 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother test: 11.\n\n- Digits: 1 (even) -1 (odd) = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 22.\n\n- Digits: 2 (even) -2 (odd) = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 121.\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1331.\n\n- Digits: 1 -3 +3 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1001.\n\n- Digits: 1 -0 +0 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 726.\n\n- Digits: 7 -2 +6 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to create a function that takes an input string representing the number.\n\nThen, use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to process each character with its index.\n\nIn the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Check if index is even or odd.\n\n- If even, keep the number as is.\n\n- If odd, negate the number.\n\nAfter mapping, sum all elements of the list using `Iteration.Reduce`.\n\nThen, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using `Math.Mod` and see if the result is zero.\n\nIf yes, output true; else, false.\n\nI need to make sure that the input is a string and that it consists only of digits. If there are non-digit characters, the function should probably handle them appropriately, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the input is a valid string of digits.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the number is negative. According to the rules, the sign doesn't matter for divisibility by 11, so I can ignore the minus sign if present.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial task, it's about a \"number,\" but in my approach, I'm treating it as a string. To make it more flexible, perhaps I should accept a number input and convert it to a string.\n\nBut looking back at the available nodes, there's no direct way to convert a number to a string. So, I'll assume the input is a string."

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI'll need to use some Midio nodes to achieve this:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n- Iterate through each character (digit) in the string.\n- Determine if the position is odd or even.\n- Perform addition or subtraction accordingly.\n- Check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's start by sketching out the steps in Midio nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToString` node for this, but I notice it's not in the provided list. Maybe there's another way to get the string representation of a number.\n\nLooking at the provided external functions, I see `Strings.Characters`, which can give me a list of characters from a string. So, perhaps I can pass the number as a string directly or find a way to convert it.\n\nWait, actually, I see `Strings.Contains`, `Strings.IsNumeric`, etc., but no direct conversion from number to string. Maybe I need to create a custom function for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to handle numbers directly without converting them to strings. For example, by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and taking modulo to get each digit.\n\nThat might be more efficient and align better with the available nodes.\n\nSo, here's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n2. Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.\n3. Determine the position by counting from the right or left. For simplicity, let's consider the rightmost digit as position 1 (odd).\n4. While the number is greater than 0:\n   a. Take the last digit using modulo 10.\n   b. Determine if the current position is odd or even.\n   c. Add or subtract the digit from the appropriate sum.\n   d. Remove the last digit by integer division by 10.\n   e. Toggle the position (from odd to even, etc.).\n5. Calculate the difference between the two sums.\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis approach avoids converting the number to a string and works directly with integers, which should be more efficient.\n\nLooking at the available nodes:\n\n- `Math.Div` for division.\n- `Math.Mod` for modulo operation.\n- `Math.Add` and `Math.Sub` for addition and subtraction.\n- `Logic.And`, `Logic.Or`, etc., for combining conditions.\n- `Std.If` for conditional execution.\n- `Std.For` for looping.\n\nI think I can implement this logic using a loop, likely a `Std.For` loop, where I iterate through each digit by repeatedly dividing the number by 10.\n\nHowever, `Std.For` typically requires a list or a range, but here I need to loop until the number becomes 0. Maybe I need to use a different approach, like recursion or a while-loop equivalent in Midio.\n\nUpon checking, I see that Midio supports recursive functions, so I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and accumulates the sums accordingly.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, let's see if I can use an iterative approach with a `Std.For` loop by estimating the number of digits in the number and looping that many times.\n\nTo estimate the number of digits, I can use logarithms, but since Midio might not have log functions, another way is to convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, I'm back to the conversion issue.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop while the number is greater than 0, processing one digit per iteration, and use a counter to keep track of the position (odd or even).\n\nBut since Midio's `Std.For` seems to require a predefined range, maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a `Std.While` node for this purpose, but scanning the provided nodes, I don't see a `Std.While`. It seems like `Std.For` is the primary looping construct available.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to work with `Std.For`. To use `Std.For`, I need to generate a range that corresponds to the number of digits in the input number.\n\nTo get the number of digits, I can use a loop that counts how many times I can divide the number by 10 before it becomes 0. But again, this requires some form of looping, which brings us back to the same issue.\n\nMaybe I can create a fixed-length loop that assumes a maximum number of digits, say 20, which should cover most practical cases.\n\nBut that seems inefficient and not elegant. There must be a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can generate a list of digits by repeatedly taking the last digit and dividing the number by 10, building a list as I go.\n\nThen, I can use `Std.Iteration.Map` to process each digit with its position.\n\nBut looking back at the provided nodes, I see `List.GenerateRange`, but that generates a range of numbers, not a list of digits.\n\nI need to create a list of digits from the input number.\n\nLet me think differently: I can create a loop that extracts each digit and builds a list, then use that list in a `Std.For` loop.\n\nBut this seems complicated without a direct way to build lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use recursion to process each digit one by one, passing along the accumulated sums and the current position.\n\nSince Midio supports recursive functions, this might be a viable approach.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Create a recursive function that takes the number, current odd sum, current even sum, and the current position (odd or even).\n- In each recursion, process the last digit based on the current position.\n- Update the sums accordingly.\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n- Toggle the position.\n- Base case: when the number becomes 0, calculate the difference between the sums and check if it's divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code-like terms:\n\nfunc is_divisible_by_11(n: Number) -> Bool {\n\n    func helper(num: Number, odd_sum: Number, even_sum: Number, is_odd: Bool) -> Bool {\n\n        if num == 0 {\n\n            return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0\n\n        } else {\n\n            digit = num % 10\n\n            if is_odd {\n\n                odd_sum += digit\n\n            } else {\n\n                even_sum += digit\n\n            }\n\n            return helper(num \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return helper(n, 0, 0, true)\n\n}\n\nThis is a recursive approach in pseudocode. Now, I need to translate this into Midio nodes.\n\nIn Midio, recursive functions can be created by having a function call itself. So, I'll define a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function recursively.\n\nI'll need to manage the state across recursive calls, i.e., the remaining number, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nIn Midio, functions can have properties that retain their values between calls, but I need to ensure that each recursion has its own set of variables.\n\nAlternatively, I can pass these values as parameters in each recursive call.\n\nGiven that, I'll define the helper function with parameters for num, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are nodes, and parameters are input properties.\n\nSo, I'll create a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function with initial parameters, and the helper function calls itself recursively.\n\nI need to make sure that the recursion terminates when num becomes 0.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.If` to check if num is 0, and either return the result or proceed with the next recursive call.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio:\n\n1. Main function `is_divisible_by_11`:\n\n- Takes input property `n: Number`.\n\n- Calls helper function with `num = n`, `odd_sum = 0`, `even_sum = 0`, `is_odd = true`.\n\n- Returns the result from the helper function.\n\n2. Helper function:\n\n- Takes input properties: `num: Number`, `odd_sum: Number`, `even_sum: Number`, `is_odd: Bool`.\n\n- If `num == 0`:\n\n- Calculate difference: `odd_sum - even_sum`.\n\n- Check if difference % 11 == 0.\n\n- Return true if yes, else false.\n\n- Else:\n\n- digit = num % 10.\n\n- If `is_odd`:\n\n- odd_sum += digit.\n\n- Else:\n\n- even_sum += digit.\n\n- Call helper with `num \n\n- Return the result of the"

                "I need to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, essentially, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are only in A and those that are only in B. In set theory terms, this is the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nSo, my function should take two lists as input and return a list containing elements that are unique to each list.\n\nLet me consider an example to clarify:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nList B: [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 5, 6] because 1 and 2 are only in A, and 5 and 6 are only in B.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations. In Midio, there might be functions or nodes that allow me to perform set differences.\n\nI recall that there is a \"Sets.Difference\" node which can compute the difference between two lists. So, if I compute the difference of A minus B and B minus A, and then combine those two differences, I should get the symmetric difference, which is what I need.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the difference of list A minus list B.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list B minus list A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists may contain duplicates, and I want to preserve them in the output.\n\nWait, but set operations typically deal with unique elements. If I use set-based nodes, duplicates might be removed. I need to ensure that duplicates are handled appropriately.\n\nLet me check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it handles duplicates.\n\nAssuming \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, which is typical for set operations, then I need to find a way to handle duplicates as per the requirements.\n\nIf duplicates are allowed and need to be preserved, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Iterate through list A and collect elements not present in list B.\n\n- Iterate through list B and collect elements not present in list A.\n\n- Combine these two collections to get the final list.\n\nThis way, duplicates in the original lists will be preserved in the output.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I need a way to iterate through list A and check for each element if it's present in list B.\n\nSimilarly, iterate through list B and check for each element if it's present in list A.\n\nThen, collect those elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nFinally, combine these two collections.\n\nIn Midio, I can use iteration nodes like \"Iteration.Map\" or \"Iteration.Filter\" to achieve this.\n\nLet me consider using \"Iteration.Filter\" for this purpose.\n\nI can create two filter instances:\n\n1. Filter list A by elements not in list B.\n\n2. Filter list B by elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can use the \"List.Contains\" node.\n\nHowever, \"List.Contains\" might not be efficient for large lists since it would involve checking each element individually.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nLet me sketch a high-level flow:\n\n- Input: list1 and list2\n\n- Filter list1 to include only elements not in list2.\n\n- Filter list2 to include only elements not in list1.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function with two input properties for the lists and one output property for the result list.\n\nInside the function, I'll set up the filter nodes as described.\n\nLet me consider how to connect the nodes.\n\nFirst, create two \"Iteration.Filter\" instances.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list2\n\nSimilarly for the second filter:\n\n- items: connected to list2\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list1\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the output lists from both filters.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenated list to the output property.\n\nNow, I need to define the handler functions for the filters.\n\nFor the first filter, the handler should check if the item is not in list2.\n\nI can create a small function that takes an item and uses \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in list2, then logically negate that.\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure these handler functions.\n\nIn Midio, functions can be created using anonymous function instances or by defining sub-functions.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll use anonymous functions for the handlers.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Filter\" accepts a function instance for the handler, I can create inline functions.\n\nWithin these inline functions, I'll use \"List.Contains\" to check membership.\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\nConnect the output of \"Logic.Not\" to the output of the handler function.\n\nAlright, let's try to visualize this.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler:\n\n    - input: item\n\n    - List.Contains(list: list2, item: item) -> contains\n\n    - Logic.Not(input: contains) -> notContains\n\n    - notContains connected to the handler's output\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nThen, List.Concat(list1_filtered, list2_filtered) -> concatenated_list\n\nconcatenated_list connected to the output property.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the data types of the elements in the lists. Assuming they are comparable, which should be the case for set operations.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Both lists are empty: should return an empty list.\n\n- One list is empty: should return the non-empty list as is.\n\n- Lists have no common elements: should return the concatenation of both lists.\n\n- Lists have some common elements: should return elements unique to each list.\n\nI need to ensure that the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nAlso, regarding duplicates:\n\n- If list1 has duplicates, and those duplicates are not in list2, they should be included in the output.\n\n- Similarly for list2.\n\nSince we're using \"List.Contains\" which likely checks for presence without considering counts, duplicates in list1 will be preserved as long as they are not present in list2.\n\nWait, but \"List.Contains\" only checks for presence, not count. So, if list1 has multiple instances of an element not in list2, all should be included in the output.\n\nSimilarly for list2.\n\nThis seems acceptable for finding dissimilar elements.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to handle duplicates based on counts, that would be more complex, but for now, I'll assume that's not required.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of elements in the output.\n\nDepending on the requirements, I might need to preserve the original order or don't care about the order.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll let the order be determined by the concatenation order.\n\nNow, time to actually create the function in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1. Define a new function in the module.\n\n2. Add two input properties for the lists.\n\n3. Add one output property for the result list.\n\n4. Add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for both lists.\n\n5. Create inline handler functions for the filters using \"List.Contains\" and \"Logic.Not\".\n\n6. Use \"List.Concat\" to combine the filtered lists.\n\n7. Connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also give meaningful names to the nodes and properties for clarity.\n\nLet me start by creating the function.\n\nIn Midio, I can right-click in the module canvas and choose \"New Function\".\n\nThen, define the input and output properties.\n\nFor the function name, perhaps \"dissimilar_elements\" or \"symmetric_difference\".\n\nI'll go with \"symmetric_difference\" to align with set theory terminology.\n\nSo, function name: symmetric_difference\n\nInputs:\n\n- list1: List\n\n- list2: List\n\nOutput:\n\n- result: List\n\nNow, add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for list1 and list2.\n\nFor each filter, create an anonymous function for the handler.\n\nWithin each handler:\n\n- Take the item input.\n\n- Use \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in the other list.\n\n- Use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\n- Connect the inverted result to the handler's output.\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the two filtered lists.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also think about performance. If the lists are large, this approach might be inefficient because for each element in list1, it checks if it's in list2, and vice versa.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this implementation, assuming that efficiency isn't a major concern.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio provides a \"Sets.SymmetricDifference\" node, I could use that directly.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a symmetric difference function available.\n\nI should check the standard library to see if such a function exists.\n\nLooking up in the \"std\" module, I find \"Sets.Symmetric"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that determines if two integers have opposite signs. In programming, the sign of an integer can be determined by checking if it's positive or negative. Zero is considered neither positive nor negative, so I need to handle that case as well.\n\nOne way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to multiply them and see if the result is negative. If the product is negative, then one is positive and the other is negative. However, this approach might not work if one or both of the numbers are zero, since zero multiplied by any number is zero, which is neither positive nor negative.\n\nAnother approach is to check the sign of each number individually and see if they differ. In most programming languages, including Midio, you can use the greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`) operators to determine the sign of a number. Specifically:\n\n- If a number is greater than zero, it's positive.\n\n- If a number is less than zero, it's negative.\n\n- If a number is equal to zero, it's neither positive nor negative.\n\nSo, for two numbers `a` and `b`, if one is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs. If both are positive or both are negative, they have the same sign. If either or both are zero, they don't have opposite signs.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio. Let's think about how to structure this function.\n\nFirst, I'll define a function that takes two integer inputs, say `a` and `b`, and returns a boolean indicating whether they have opposite signs.\n\nI can use conditional nodes to check the signs of both numbers and then compare them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Check if `a` is greater than zero.\n\n2. Check if `b` is greater than zero.\n\n3. If one is greater than zero and the other is not, then they have opposite signs.\n\n4. However, I need to consider the case when one or both are zero. Zero should not be considered as having an opposite sign with any number, including itself.\n\nSo, I need to adjust the logic to handle zeros appropriately.\n\nPerhaps a better way is:\n\n- If `a` is positive and `b` is negative, or if `a` is negative and `b` is positive, then they have opposite signs.\n\n- If both are positive, both are negative, or either is zero, they do not have opposite signs.\n\nIn code, this can be represented using logical operators.\n\nLet me try to write this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to use comparison nodes to check the signs and logical nodes to combine the results.\n\nAlso, I should consider the possibility of overflow if I were to multiply the numbers, but since I'm not multiplying them, that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nLet me sketch this out.\n\nAssume I have two input integers, `a` and `b`.\n\nI'll need:\n\n- A node to check if `a > 0`\n\n- A node to check if `b > 0`\n\nThen, I can use these results to determine if they have opposite signs.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If `a > 0` is true and `b > 0` is false, or if `a > 0` is false and `b > 0` is true, then they have opposite signs.\n\nIn other words, the XOR (exclusive or) of `(a > 0)` and `(b > 0)`.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to perform this operation.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- Two greater-than nodes for `a > 0` and `b > 0`\n\n- An XOR node to combine their results\n\n- Finally, output the result of the XOR as the function's output\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that if either `a` or `b` is zero, the function correctly returns false, since zero doesn't have an opposite sign.\n\nGiven that zero is neither greater than nor less than zero, the checks should naturally handle zeros correctly.\n\nLet me verify this:\n\n- If `a` is zero and `b` is positive: `a > 0` is false, `b > 0` is true \u2192 XOR is true, but zero shouldn't be considered as having an opposite sign.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, my initial approach has a flaw.\n\nTo fix this, I need to ensure that neither `a` nor `b` is zero when considering them to have opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, I need to add checks for `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nSo, the complete logic should be:\n\n- If `a` is not zero and `b` is not zero and their signs are different, then return true.\n\n- Otherwise, return false.\n\nIn terms of nodes:\n\n- Check if `a > 0`\n\n- Check if `b > 0`\n\n- XOR these two results to see if they have different signs\n\n- Check if `a != 0`\n\n- Check if `b != 0`\n\n- Combine these with logical AND to ensure neither is zero and their signs are different.\n\nSo, the final output is `(a > 0) xor (b > 0)` and `a != 0` and `b != 0`.\n\nWait, actually, since `a != 0` is equivalent to `a > 0 or a < 0`, and similarly for `b`.\n\nBut to keep it simple, I can first check if both are not zero, and then check if their signs are different.\n\nIn code, that would be:\n\n`(a != 0) and (b != 0) and ((a > 0) != (b > 0))`\n\nIn Midio, I can represent this using comparison nodes and logic gates.\n\nLet me outline the nodes I'll need:\n\n1. Node to check `a != 0`\n\n2. Node to check `b != 0`\n\n3. Node to check `a > 0`\n\n4. Node to check `b > 0`\n\n5. Node to compute `(a > 0) != (b > 0)` (XOR)\n\n6. Node to compute `(a != 0) and (b != 0) and XOR`\n\nThen, output the result of this combined logic.\n\nI need to make sure that the XOR is correctly implemented. In Midio, there might be an XOR node, or I can use a combination of logical operators to achieve the same effect.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the expression node to write a simple expression that checks for opposite signs.\n\nIn many programming languages, a quick way to check if two numbers have opposite signs is to use the condition `(a ^ b) < 0`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. However, I'm not sure if Midio supports bitwise operations, so I'll stick with comparison and logical operators.\n\nLet me consider writing an expression for the condition.\n\nSomething like:\n\n`(a > 0 && b < 0) || (a < 0 && b > 0)`\n\nThis expression directly checks if one is positive and the other is negative.\n\nAnd to handle zeros correctly, since zero is neither positive nor negative, the expression already excludes zeros because zero doesn't satisfy `a > 0` or `a < 0`.\n\nTherefore, if either `a` or `b` is zero, the expression will evaluate to false, which is the desired behavior.\n\nSo, using this expression seems straightforward and correct.\n\nIn Midio, I can use the logic nodes to build this expression.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio has a built-in function for checking signs, I could use that, but assuming it doesn't, I'll proceed with the above approach.\n\nLet me sketch this out in terms of nodes:\n\n- Compare `a > 0`\n\n- Compare `b < 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Compare `a < 0`\n\n- Compare `b > 0`\n\n- And these two\n\n- Or the two And results\n\nThis will give me the desired output.\n\nLet me confirm with some examples:\n\n1. a = 5, b = -3\n\n- a > 0: true\n\n- b < 0: true\n\n- first And: true\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n2. a = -2, b = 4\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: true\n\n- Or: true\n\n- output: true\n\n3. a = 0, b = 5\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: true\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n4. a = -3, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: true\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n5. a = 0, b = 0\n\n- a > 0: false\n\n- b < 0: false\n\n- first And: false\n\n- a < 0: false\n\n- b > 0: false\n\n- second And: false\n\n- Or: false\n\n- output: false\n\n6. a = 3, b ="

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is divisible by 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI need to implement this logic using the available nodes in Midio. Let's see what nodes I can use:\n\n- **Strings** nodes to handle the conversion of the number to a string and accessing individual characters.\n- **Math** nodes for arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.\n- **Iteration** nodes to loop through each digit.\n- **Logic** nodes to check if the final difference is divisible by 11.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the input number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToLower` node, but since it converts to lowercase, which isn't necessary for digits, maybe there's a better way. Actually, I think there might be a `ToString` function or something similar, but since it's not listed, perhaps I need to assume that the input is already a string or find another way.\n\nWait, looking back at the list of external functions, there's no direct `ToString` function. So, I'll assume the input is provided as a string representing the number.\n\nNext, I need to iterate through each character in the string, convert each character to a digit, and then apply the alternating addition and subtraction.\n\nI can use the `Strings.Characters` node to get a list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, I'll use the `Iteration.Map` node to process each character in the list. In the map function, I'll convert each character to a number.\n\nAfter that, I need to calculate the alternating sum. For this, I might need to keep track of whether the current digit is in an odd or even position. I can use the index provided by the `Iteration.Map` node to determine the position.\n\nIn the map function, if the index is even, add the digit to one sum; if odd, subtract it from another sum.\n\nWait, actually, to simplify, I can calculate a single sum where I alternate between adding and subtracting based on the position.\n\nFinally, check if this sum is divisible by 11.\n\nLet me outline the steps in more detail:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to convert each character to a number and apply the alternating sign based on its position.\n4. Sum all the results from the map function.\n5. Check if the sum is divisible by 11 using the `Math.Mod` node and see if the result is zero.\n\nWait, but in the standard divisibility rule for 11, it's the difference between the sum of digits in odd positions and the sum of digits in even positions that should be divisible by 11.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to calculate two separate sums: one for odd positions and one for even positions, then compute their difference, and check if that difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis might be more accurate to the standard rule.\n\nTherefore, I'll adjust my plan:\n\n1. Take the input number as a string.\n2. Use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n3. Use `Iteration.Map` to process each character:\n   - Convert the character to a number.\n   - Based on the index, add to sum1 if odd position, add to sum2 if even position.\n4. Calculate the difference between sum1 and sum2.\n5. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nWait, but in the standard rule, it's sum of digits in odd positions minus sum of digits in even positions.\n\nI need to make sure I'm consistent with that.\n\nLet me try to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, get the list of characters from the input string.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to create a new list where each element is the digit value with the appropriate sign based on its position.\n\nFor example, for number 121:\n\n- Positions: 1 (odd), 2 (even), 1 (odd)\n\n- Sum1 (odd positions): 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- Sum2 (even positions): 2\n\n- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother example: 123456789\n\n- Positions: 1(odd), 2(even), 3(odd), 4(even), 5(odd), 6(even), 7(odd), 8(even), 9(odd)\n\n- Sum1: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\n\n- Sum2: 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20\n\n- Difference: 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nSo, in the map function, I need to:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Based on index (starting from 0):\n\n- If index is even, add the digit to sum1.\n\n- If index is odd, add the digit to sum2.\n\nThen, compute sum1 - sum2 and check divisibility by 11.\n\nAlternatively, I can have two separate sums and accumulate them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps using `Iteration.Map` to create a list where each element is either added or subtracted based on its position, then summing the list.\n\nWait, that could work too.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSo, in the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- If index is even, keep the digit as is.\n\n- If index is odd, negate the digit.\n\nThen, sum all elements of the list. If the sum is divisible by 11, then the number is divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nLet me verify with the earlier examples.\n\nFor 121:\n\n- Digits: 1 (even position, positive), 2 (odd position, negative), 1 (even position, positive)\n\n- Sum: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nFor 123456789:\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = 1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 = (1+3+5+7+9) - (2+4+6+8) = 25 - 20 = 5, not divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother test: 11.\n\n- Digits: 1 (even) -1 (odd) = 0, which is divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 22.\n\n- Digits: 2 (even) -2 (odd) = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 121.\n\n- Digits: 1 -2 +1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1331.\n\n- Digits: 1 -3 +3 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 1001.\n\n- Digits: 1 -0 +0 -1 = 0, divisible by 11.\n\nAnother test: 726.\n\n- Digits: 7 -2 +6 = 11, which is divisible by 11.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to create a function that takes an input string representing the number.\n\nThen, use `Strings.Characters` to get a list of characters.\n\nThen, use `Iteration.Map` to process each character with its index.\n\nIn the map function:\n\n- Convert character to number.\n\n- Check if index is even or odd.\n\n- If even, keep the number as is.\n\n- If odd, negate the number.\n\nAfter mapping, sum all elements of the list using `Iteration.Reduce`.\n\nThen, check if the sum is divisible by 11 using `Math.Mod` and see if the result is zero.\n\nIf yes, output true; else, false.\n\nI need to make sure that the input is a string and that it consists only of digits. If there are non-digit characters, the function should probably handle them appropriately, but for simplicity, I'll assume that the input is a valid string of digits.\n\nAlso, I need to handle the case where the number is negative. According to the rules, the sign doesn't matter for divisibility by 11, so I can ignore the minus sign if present.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial task, it's about a \"number,\" but in my approach, I'm treating it as a string. To make it more flexible, perhaps I should accept a number input and convert it to a string.\n\nBut looking back at the available nodes, there's no direct way to convert a number to a string. So, I'll assume the input is a string."

                "I'm going to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. To do this, I'll use the standard approach for checking divisibility by 11, which involves alternating sums of digits.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Take the number and convert it to a string to easily access individual digits.\n2. Iterate through each digit, starting from the first one.\n3. For every odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), add the digit to a sum.\n4. For every even position (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), subtract the digit from another sum.\n5. If the difference between these two sums is a multiple of 11 (including zero), then the original number is divisible by 11.\n\nI'll need to use some Midio nodes to achieve this:\n\n- Convert the number to a string.\n- Iterate through each character (digit) in the string.\n- Determine if the position is odd or even.\n- Perform addition or subtraction accordingly.\n- Check if the result is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's start by sketching out the steps in Midio nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the number to a string. I can use the `Strings.ToString` node for this, but I notice it's not in the provided list. Maybe there's another way to get the string representation of a number.\n\nLooking at the provided external functions, I see `Strings.Characters`, which can give me a list of characters from a string. So, perhaps I can pass the number as a string directly or find a way to convert it.\n\nWait, actually, I see `Strings.Contains`, `Strings.IsNumeric`, etc., but no direct conversion from number to string. Maybe I need to create a custom function for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to handle numbers directly without converting them to strings. For example, by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and taking modulo to get each digit.\n\nThat might be more efficient and align better with the available nodes.\n\nSo, here's an alternative plan:\n\n1. Take the input number.\n2. Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.\n3. Determine the position by counting from the right or left. For simplicity, let's consider the rightmost digit as position 1 (odd).\n4. While the number is greater than 0:\n   a. Take the last digit using modulo 10.\n   b. Determine if the current position is odd or even.\n   c. Add or subtract the digit from the appropriate sum.\n   d. Remove the last digit by integer division by 10.\n   e. Toggle the position (from odd to even, etc.).\n5. Calculate the difference between the two sums.\n6. Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n\nThis approach avoids converting the number to a string and works directly with integers, which should be more efficient.\n\nLooking at the available nodes:\n\n- `Math.Div` for division.\n- `Math.Mod` for modulo operation.\n- `Math.Add` and `Math.Sub` for addition and subtraction.\n- `Logic.And`, `Logic.Or`, etc., for combining conditions.\n- `Std.If` for conditional execution.\n- `Std.For` for looping.\n\nI think I can implement this logic using a loop, likely a `Std.For` loop, where I iterate through each digit by repeatedly dividing the number by 10.\n\nHowever, `Std.For` typically requires a list or a range, but here I need to loop until the number becomes 0. Maybe I need to use a different approach, like recursion or a while-loop equivalent in Midio.\n\nUpon checking, I see that Midio supports recursive functions, so I can create a recursive function that processes one digit at a time and accumulates the sums accordingly.\n\nBut, to keep it simple, let's see if I can use an iterative approach with a `Std.For` loop by estimating the number of digits in the number and looping that many times.\n\nTo estimate the number of digits, I can use logarithms, but since Midio might not have log functions, another way is to convert the number to a string and get its length, but again, I'm back to the conversion issue.\n\nAlternatively, I can loop while the number is greater than 0, processing one digit per iteration, and use a counter to keep track of the position (odd or even).\n\nBut since Midio's `Std.For` seems to require a predefined range, maybe I need to use a different control structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a `Std.While` node for this purpose, but scanning the provided nodes, I don't see a `Std.While`. It seems like `Std.For` is the primary looping construct available.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to work with `Std.For`. To use `Std.For`, I need to generate a range that corresponds to the number of digits in the input number.\n\nTo get the number of digits, I can use a loop that counts how many times I can divide the number by 10 before it becomes 0. But again, this requires some form of looping, which brings us back to the same issue.\n\nMaybe I can create a fixed-length loop that assumes a maximum number of digits, say 20, which should cover most practical cases.\n\nBut that seems inefficient and not elegant. There must be a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can generate a list of digits by repeatedly taking the last digit and dividing the number by 10, building a list as I go.\n\nThen, I can use `Std.Iteration.Map` to process each digit with its position.\n\nBut looking back at the provided nodes, I see `List.GenerateRange`, but that generates a range of numbers, not a list of digits.\n\nI need to create a list of digits from the input number.\n\nLet me think differently: I can create a loop that extracts each digit and builds a list, then use that list in a `Std.For` loop.\n\nBut this seems complicated without a direct way to build lists.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use recursion to process each digit one by one, passing along the accumulated sums and the current position.\n\nSince Midio supports recursive functions, this might be a viable approach.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n- Create a recursive function that takes the number, current odd sum, current even sum, and the current position (odd or even).\n- In each recursion, process the last digit based on the current position.\n- Update the sums accordingly.\n- Remove the last digit from the number.\n- Toggle the position.\n- Base case: when the number becomes 0, calculate the difference between the sums and check if it's divisible by 11.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps in code-like terms:\n\nfunc is_divisible_by_11(n: Number) -> Bool {\n\n    func helper(num: Number, odd_sum: Number, even_sum: Number, is_odd: Bool) -> Bool {\n\n        if num == 0 {\n\n            return (odd_sum - even_sum) % 11 == 0\n\n        } else {\n\n            digit = num % 10\n\n            if is_odd {\n\n                odd_sum += digit\n\n            } else {\n\n                even_sum += digit\n\n            }\n\n            return helper(num \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return helper(n, 0, 0, true)\n\n}\n\nThis is a recursive approach in pseudocode. Now, I need to translate this into Midio nodes.\n\nIn Midio, recursive functions can be created by having a function call itself. So, I'll define a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function recursively.\n\nI'll need to manage the state across recursive calls, i.e., the remaining number, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nIn Midio, functions can have properties that retain their values between calls, but I need to ensure that each recursion has its own set of variables.\n\nAlternatively, I can pass these values as parameters in each recursive call.\n\nGiven that, I'll define the helper function with parameters for num, odd_sum, even_sum, and is_odd.\n\nBut in Midio, functions are nodes, and parameters are input properties.\n\nSo, I'll create a main function `is_divisible_by_11` that calls a helper function with initial parameters, and the helper function calls itself recursively.\n\nI need to make sure that the recursion terminates when num becomes 0.\n\nIn Midio, I can use `Std.If` to check if num is 0, and either return the result or proceed with the next recursive call.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in Midio:\n\n1. Main function `is_divisible_by_11`:\n\n- Takes input property `n: Number`.\n\n- Calls helper function with `num = n`, `odd_sum = 0`, `even_sum = 0`, `is_odd = true`.\n\n- Returns the result from the helper function.\n\n2. Helper function:\n\n- Takes input properties: `num: Number`, `odd_sum: Number`, `even_sum: Number`, `is_odd: Bool`.\n\n- If `num == 0`:\n\n- Calculate difference: `odd_sum - even_sum`.\n\n- Check if difference % 11 == 0.\n\n- Return true if yes, else false.\n\n- Else:\n\n- digit = num % 10.\n\n- If `is_odd`:\n\n- odd_sum += digit.\n\n- Else:\n\n- even_sum += digit.\n\n- Call helper with `num \n\n- Return the result of the"

                "I need to create a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given lists. So, essentially, I want to identify elements that are unique to each list, meaning they don't appear in both lists.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"dissimilar elements\" means in this context. If I have two lists, say list A and list B, the dissimilar elements would be those that are only in A and those that are only in B. In set theory terms, this is the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n\nSo, my function should take two lists as input and return a list containing elements that are unique to each list.\n\nLet me consider an example to clarify:\n\nList A: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nList B: [3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nThe dissimilar elements would be [1, 2, 5, 6] because 1 and 2 are only in A, and 5 and 6 are only in B.\n\nTo achieve this, I can use set operations. In Midio, there might be functions or nodes that allow me to perform set differences.\n\nI recall that there is a \"Sets.Difference\" node which can compute the difference between two lists. So, if I compute the difference of A minus B and B minus A, and then combine those two differences, I should get the symmetric difference, which is what I need.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the difference of list A minus list B.\n\n2. Compute the difference of list B minus list A.\n\n3. Concatenate the results from step 1 and step 2 to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n\nI should also consider if the lists contain duplicates. If they do, I need to decide how to handle them. For simplicity, I'll assume that the lists may contain duplicates, and I want to preserve them in the output.\n\nWait, but set operations typically deal with unique elements. If I use set-based nodes, duplicates might be removed. I need to ensure that duplicates are handled appropriately.\n\nLet me check the documentation for \"Sets.Difference\" to see how it handles duplicates.\n\nAssuming \"Sets.Difference\" removes duplicates, which is typical for set operations, then I need to find a way to handle duplicates as per the requirements.\n\nIf duplicates are allowed and need to be preserved, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Iterate through list A and collect elements not present in list B.\n\n- Iterate through list B and collect elements not present in list A.\n\n- Combine these two collections to get the final list.\n\nThis way, duplicates in the original lists will be preserved in the output.\n\nI need to implement this logic in Midio using the available nodes.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I need a way to iterate through list A and check for each element if it's present in list B.\n\nSimilarly, iterate through list B and check for each element if it's present in list A.\n\nThen, collect those elements that are not present in the other list.\n\nFinally, combine these two collections.\n\nIn Midio, I can use iteration nodes like \"Iteration.Map\" or \"Iteration.Filter\" to achieve this.\n\nLet me consider using \"Iteration.Filter\" for this purpose.\n\nI can create two filter instances:\n\n1. Filter list A by elements not in list B.\n\n2. Filter list B by elements not in list A.\n\nThen, concatenate the results of these two filters.\n\nTo check if an element is present in another list, I can use the \"List.Contains\" node.\n\nHowever, \"List.Contains\" might not be efficient for large lists since it would involve checking each element individually.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nLet me sketch a high-level flow:\n\n- Input: list1 and list2\n\n- Filter list1 to include only elements not in list2.\n\n- Filter list2 to include only elements not in list1.\n\n- Concatenate the two filtered lists.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function with two input properties for the lists and one output property for the result list.\n\nInside the function, I'll set up the filter nodes as described.\n\nLet me consider how to connect the nodes.\n\nFirst, create two \"Iteration.Filter\" instances.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list2\n\nSimilarly for the second filter:\n\n- items: connected to list2\n\n- handler: a function that takes an item and returns true if it's not in list1\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the output lists from both filters.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenated list to the output property.\n\nNow, I need to define the handler functions for the filters.\n\nFor the first filter, the handler should check if the item is not in list2.\n\nI can create a small function that takes an item and uses \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in list2, then logically negate that.\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nLet me think about how to structure these handler functions.\n\nIn Midio, functions can be created using anonymous function instances or by defining sub-functions.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll use anonymous functions for the handlers.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Filter\" accepts a function instance for the handler, I can create inline functions.\n\nWithin these inline functions, I'll use \"List.Contains\" to check membership.\n\nThen, use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\nConnect the output of \"Logic.Not\" to the output of the handler function.\n\nAlright, let's try to visualize this.\n\nFor the first filter:\n\n- items: connected to list1\n\n- handler:\n\n    - input: item\n\n    - List.Contains(list: list2, item: item) -> contains\n\n    - Logic.Not(input: contains) -> notContains\n\n    - notContains connected to the handler's output\n\nSimilarly for the second filter.\n\nThen, List.Concat(list1_filtered, list2_filtered) -> concatenated_list\n\nconcatenated_list connected to the output property.\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nI should also consider the data types of the elements in the lists. Assuming they are comparable, which should be the case for set operations.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Both lists are empty: should return an empty list.\n\n- One list is empty: should return the non-empty list as is.\n\n- Lists have no common elements: should return the concatenation of both lists.\n\n- Lists have some common elements: should return elements unique to each list.\n\nI need to ensure that the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nAlso, regarding duplicates:\n\n- If list1 has duplicates, and those duplicates are not in list2, they should be included in the output.\n\n- Similarly for list2.\n\nSince we're using \"List.Contains\" which likely checks for presence without considering counts, duplicates in list1 will be preserved as long as they are not present in list2.\n\nWait, but \"List.Contains\" only checks for presence, not count. So, if list1 has multiple instances of an element not in list2, all should be included in the output.\n\nSimilarly for list2.\n\nThis seems acceptable for finding dissimilar elements.\n\nAlternatively, if I need to handle duplicates based on counts, that would be more complex, but for now, I'll assume that's not required.\n\nAnother consideration is the order of elements in the output.\n\nDepending on the requirements, I might need to preserve the original order or don't care about the order.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll let the order be determined by the concatenation order.\n\nNow, time to actually create the function in Midio.\n\nI'll need to:\n\n1. Define a new function in the module.\n\n2. Add two input properties for the lists.\n\n3. Add one output property for the result list.\n\n4. Add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for both lists.\n\n5. Create inline handler functions for the filters using \"List.Contains\" and \"Logic.Not\".\n\n6. Use \"List.Concat\" to combine the filtered lists.\n\n7. Connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also give meaningful names to the nodes and properties for clarity.\n\nLet me start by creating the function.\n\nIn Midio, I can right-click in the module canvas and choose \"New Function\".\n\nThen, define the input and output properties.\n\nFor the function name, perhaps \"dissimilar_elements\" or \"symmetric_difference\".\n\nI'll go with \"symmetric_difference\" to align with set theory terminology.\n\nSo, function name: symmetric_difference\n\nInputs:\n\n- list1: List\n\n- list2: List\n\nOutput:\n\n- result: List\n\nNow, add instances for \"Iteration.Filter\" for list1 and list2.\n\nFor each filter, create an anonymous function for the handler.\n\nWithin each handler:\n\n- Take the item input.\n\n- Use \"List.Contains\" to check if it's in the other list.\n\n- Use \"Logic.Not\" to invert the result.\n\n- Connect the inverted result to the handler's output.\n\nThen, use \"List.Concat\" to combine the two filtered lists.\n\nFinally, connect the concatenation output to the output property.\n\nI should also think about performance. If the lists are large, this approach might be inefficient because for each element in list1, it checks if it's in list2, and vice versa.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with this implementation, assuming that efficiency isn't a major concern.\n\nAlternatively, if Midio provides a \"Sets.SymmetricDifference\" node, I could use that directly.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a symmetric difference function available.\n\nI should check the standard library to see if such a function exists.\n\nLooking up in the \"std\" module, I find \"Sets.Symmetric"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that calculates the sum of an array. Since I'm working with Midio, which seems to be a node-based programming language, I'll have to design this functionality using nodes and connections.\n\nFirst, I should understand what inputs and outputs this function will have. The input is an array of numbers, and the output should be the sum of those numbers, which is a single number.\n\nIn Midio, functions are likely defined as modules or specific node configurations that can be reused. So, I need to create a module that takes an array as input and outputs the sum.\n\nI'll probably need to iterate over the array, adding each element to a running total. For this, I might need a loop construct, perhaps something like a \"for\" loop node, and a node to handle addition.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Start with an initial sum of zero.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the array.\n\n3. Add each element to the running sum.\n\n4. Once all elements have been added, output the sum.\n\nI need to find nodes that can help me achieve this. From the list of external functions provided, there's a \"Std.For\" node that seems useful for iterating over a list. There's also a \"Math.Add\" node that can be used to add numbers.\n\nSo, I can set up a \"Std.For\" node to iterate over the array. Inside the loop, I'll use a \"Math.Add\" node to add each element to a running total.\n\nI might need a way to keep track of the running sum across iterations. Perhaps there's a node for accumulating values or maintaining state within the loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a reduce function or something similar that can apply a function to all elements of an array and accumulate the result.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions, there's an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node. This sounds perfect for summing an array because it applies a function to each element and accumulates the result.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" where the function is \"Math.Add\", and the initial value is zero.\n\nLet me consider how to set this up:\n\n- Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- The output of \"Iteration.Reduce\" would be the sum of the array.\n\nThis seems straightforward. I need to make sure that \"Iteration.Reduce\" works by accumulating the sum correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available or doesn't work as expected, I can fall back to using a \"Std.For\" loop and manually accumulate the sum.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop, use \"Math.Add\" to add the current item to a running total.\n\n- Keep track of the running total across iterations.\n\n- After the loop finishes, output the final sum.\n\nBut using \"Iteration.Reduce\" seems more efficient and cleaner.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty array. In that case, the sum should be zero, which aligns with the initial value.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Create a new function module called \"SumArray\".\n\n- Define an input for the array.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with \"Math.Add\" as the reducer and initial value zero.\n\n- Output the result from \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should work.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available, I can use \"Std.For\" and accumulate the sum manually.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each item in the array.\n\n- In each iteration, add the current item to \"sum\".\n\n- After the loop, output \"sum\".\n\nI need to figure out how to manage variables and state in Midio. Perhaps there are nodes for variable assignment and retrieval.\n\nFor example, there might be a \"Set Variable\" node and a \"Get Variable\" node.\n\nSo, in the loop, after adding the current item to the sum, set the \"sum\" variable to the new value.\n\nThen, in the next iteration, get the current value of \"sum\", add the next item, and set it again.\n\nFinally, after the loop, get the value of \"sum\" and output it.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me consider which approach is better:\n\n- Using \"Iteration.Reduce\": simpler, less error-prone, and likely more efficient.\n\n- Using \"Std.For\" with variable assignment: more manual, but still achievable.\n\nGiven the choice, I'll prefer \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nBut to ensure that it works correctly, I should verify its behavior.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Reduce\" applies the reducer function cumulatively to the elements of the array, starting from the initial value, this should precisely compute the sum.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Create a new function module named \"SumArray\".\n\n2. Define an input node for the array.\n\n3. Instantiate an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node.\n\n4. Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n5. Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n6. Set the initial value to zero.\n\n7. Define an output node connected to the output of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should give me the sum of the array.\n\nI should also consider the data types. Assuming the array contains numbers, and the sum should be a number, this should work fine.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Empty array: should return zero.\n\n- Array with one element: should return that element.\n\n- Array with negative numbers: should handle negatives correctly.\n\n- Array with floating-point numbers: should handle decimals correctly.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Math.Add\" node can handle floating-point numbers if necessary.\n\nAssuming \"Math.Add\" supports numbers in general, including floats, this should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to define a new module for this function.\n\nIn Midio, modules seem to be defined with positions (x, y coordinates), and nodes are connected via links.\n\nEach node has inputs and outputs, and data flows from one node to another.\n\nSo, in my \"SumArray\" module, I'll have:\n\n- An input node for the array.\n\n- An instance of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Connections from the array input to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s \"items\" input.\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- An output node connected to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s output.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct node names and connections as per Midio's syntax.\n\nGiven that, here's a rough sketch of what the module definition might look like:\n\nmodule() SumArray {\n\n    in(x: 0, y: 0, name: \"array\") property(Array) array_input\n\n    out(x: 200, y: 0, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_output\n\n    instance(x: 100, y: 0) reduce root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\n        reducer: root.Std.Math.Add\n\n        initial_value: 0\n\n    }\n\n    array_input -> reduce.items\n\n    reduce.output -> sum_output\n\n}\n\nThis is a simplified representation. The actual syntax might require more details, such as specifying data types or handling triggers for execution.\n\nI should also consider how the function is executed. Maybe there's an execute trigger that needs to be connected appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the \"Iteration.Reduce\" node correctly accumulates the sum by applying \"Math.Add\" to each element starting from zero.\n\nIf \"Iteration.Reduce\" doesn't support setting the reducer function directly, I might need to create an instance of \"Math.Add\" and pass it as the reducer.\n\nFor example:\n\ninstance(x: 50, y: 50) add root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\nThen, connect this add instance to the reduce node's reducer input.\n\nWait, perhaps the reducer is a function that takes two arguments and returns their addition.\n\nIn that case, I need to provide a function that adds two numbers.\n\nIn Midio, functions might be passed as references to nodes or instances.\n\nAssuming that \"Math.Add\" can be used as the reducer function, I can connect it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" expects a specific type of function, I might need to adapt \"Math.Add\" to match that expectation.\n\nThis could get complicated, so perhaps starting with \"Iteration.Reduce\" is a good approach, but I should be prepared to fallback to a manual loop if necessary.\n\nLet me consider how to implement the sum using a \"Std.For\" loop.\n\nIn this case:\n\n1. Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each element in the array.\n\n3. In each iteration, add the current element to \"sum\" and update \"sum\".\n\n4. After the loop, output the final value of \"sum\".\n\nTo manage the \"sum\" variable, I might need \"Set Variable\" and \"Get Variable\" nodes.\n\nAssuming that, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Set Variable node to initialize sum to zero.\n\n- Std.For node to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the current sum.\n\n- Math.Add node to add the current item to the sum.\n\n- Set Variable node to update sum with the new value.\n\n- After the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the final sum.\n\n- Output it.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but it should work.\n\nCompar"

Determine the number of positions to rotate the list to the right.\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the remaining elements.\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order, so that the last n elements become the first, and the remaining elements follow.\n\nFor example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation count is 2, the function should return [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].\n\nI need to handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length. In such cases, the effective rotation can be found by taking the rotation count modulo the list length.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll create a function called rotateRight that takes two inputs: the list to rotate and the number of positions to rotate.\n\nI'll need to calculate the effective rotation count by taking the rotation count modulo the length of the list. This will handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, I'll split the list into two parts:\n\n- The last n elements.\n\n- The remaining elements from the start to the (length - n) position.\n\nFinally, I'll concatenate these two parts, with the last n elements coming first, followed by the remaining elements.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty list or a rotation count of 0, which should return the list unchanged.\n\nLet me sketch this out in pseudocode:\n\nfunction rotateRight(list, rotationCount):\n\nif list is empty or rotationCount is 0:\n\nreturn list\n\neffectiveRotation = rotationCount % length of list\n\nif effectiveRotation == 0:\n\nreturn list\n\nsplitPoint = length of list - effectiveRotation\n\nrotatedList = concatenate(list from splitPoint to end, list from start to splitPoint)\n\nreturn rotatedList\n\nNow, I need to translate this logic into Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need the following nodes:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to calculate the effective rotation.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nI should also handle the case where the rotation count is 0 or the list is empty, in which case I can directly return the list.\n\nLet me think about how to wire these nodes together.\n\nFirst, check if the list is empty or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list as is.\n\nOtherwise, calculate the effective rotation: rotationCount modulo list length.\n\nIf effective rotation is 0, output the list as is.\n\nElse, determine the split point: list length minus effective rotation.\n\nUse List.Slice to get the last n elements (from splitPoint to end).\n\nUse List.Slice again to get the remaining elements (from start to splitPoint).\n\nUse List.Concat to concatenate the last n elements with the remaining elements.\n\nOutput the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, to get the last n elements, start = length - n, end = length.\n\nTo get the first part, start = 0, end = length - n.\n\nI should also consider negative rotation counts. If rotationCount is negative, it should rotate to the left.\n\nBut since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nHowever, to make the function more robust, I can take the absolute value of rotationCount.\n\nWait, but the task says \"to the right direction\", so I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nIf rotationCount is negative, perhaps I should treat it as rotating to the left, but to keep it simple, I'll assume it's non-negative.\n\nLet me proceed with rotationCount being non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider an example.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 2\n\nlength: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5] (indices 3 to 5)\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3] (indices 0 to 3)\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 0\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 5 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 7\n\neffectiveRotation: 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5]\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, let's consider an empty list:\n\nList: []\n\nrotationCount: any value\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 0? Need to handle division by zero.\n\nIn Midio, List.Length of an empty list is 0.\n\nSo, effectiveRotation = rotationCount % 0. But modulo operation with 0 should be handled carefully.\n\nIn programming, n % 0 is undefined, but in practice, it might return n or raise an error.\n\nTo handle this, I'll add a condition: if list length is 0, return the empty list immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if rotationCount is 0, return the list as is.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function called rotateRight with inputs: list and rotationCount.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Check if list length is 0 or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list.\n\n- Otherwise, calculate effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- If effectiveRotation is 0, output the list.\n\n- Else, calculate splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate last n elements with remaining elements.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\nFor remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen concatenate them in that order.\n\nI should also consider if rotationCount is larger than list length.\n\nBut since I'm using modulo operation, effectiveRotation will be within 0 to listLength - 1.\n\nSo, it should handle cases where rotationCount > listLength correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this logic step by step in Midio.\n\nFirst, get the list length using List.Length.\n\nThen, compute effectiveRotation using Math.Modulo with rotationCount and listLength.\n\nThen, check if effectiveRotation is 0. If so, output the original list.\n\nOtherwise, compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\nThen, use List.Slice twice:\n\n- Once for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Once for remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen, use List.Concat to concatenate these two slices in the order: last n elements first, then remaining elements.\n\nFinally, output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to ensure that all paths lead to an output.\n\nAlso, handle the case where listLength is 0 to avoid division by zero in modulo operation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use conditional logic with If nodes to handle these cases.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- Conditional checks using If nodes to handle cases where listLength is 0 or effectiveRotation is 0.\n\n- Math.Subtract to compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- List.Slice to get the two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate them.\n\n- Output the result.\n\nLet me sketch this in a more detailed step-by-step manner.\n\n1. Get listLength using List.Length on the input list.\n\n2. Check if listLength == 0 or rotationCount == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Compute effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength using Math.Modulo.\n\n4. Check if effectiveRotation == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 5.\n\n5. Compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation using Math.Subtract.\n\n6. Use List.Slice to get last n elements:\n\n- Start index: splitPoint\n\n- End index: listLength"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that calculates the sum of an array. Since I'm working with Midio, which seems to be a node-based programming language, I'll have to design this functionality using nodes and connections.\n\nFirst, I should understand what inputs and outputs this function will have. The input is an array of numbers, and the output should be the sum of those numbers, which is a single number.\n\nIn Midio, functions are likely defined as modules or specific node configurations that can be reused. So, I need to create a module that takes an array as input and outputs the sum.\n\nI'll probably need to iterate over the array, adding each element to a running total. For this, I might need a loop construct, perhaps something like a \"for\" loop node, and a node to handle addition.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Start with an initial sum of zero.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the array.\n\n3. Add each element to the running sum.\n\n4. Once all elements have been added, output the sum.\n\nI need to find nodes that can help me achieve this. From the list of external functions provided, there's a \"Std.For\" node that seems useful for iterating over a list. There's also a \"Math.Add\" node that can be used to add numbers.\n\nSo, I can set up a \"Std.For\" node to iterate over the array. Inside the loop, I'll use a \"Math.Add\" node to add each element to a running total.\n\nI might need a way to keep track of the running sum across iterations. Perhaps there's a node for accumulating values or maintaining state within the loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a reduce function or something similar that can apply a function to all elements of an array and accumulate the result.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions, there's an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node. This sounds perfect for summing an array because it applies a function to each element and accumulates the result.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" where the function is \"Math.Add\", and the initial value is zero.\n\nLet me consider how to set this up:\n\n- Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- The output of \"Iteration.Reduce\" would be the sum of the array.\n\nThis seems straightforward. I need to make sure that \"Iteration.Reduce\" works by accumulating the sum correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available or doesn't work as expected, I can fall back to using a \"Std.For\" loop and manually accumulate the sum.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop, use \"Math.Add\" to add the current item to a running total.\n\n- Keep track of the running total across iterations.\n\n- After the loop finishes, output the final sum.\n\nBut using \"Iteration.Reduce\" seems more efficient and cleaner.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty array. In that case, the sum should be zero, which aligns with the initial value.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Create a new function module called \"SumArray\".\n\n- Define an input for the array.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with \"Math.Add\" as the reducer and initial value zero.\n\n- Output the result from \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should work.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available, I can use \"Std.For\" and accumulate the sum manually.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each item in the array.\n\n- In each iteration, add the current item to \"sum\".\n\n- After the loop, output \"sum\".\n\nI need to figure out how to manage variables and state in Midio. Perhaps there are nodes for variable assignment and retrieval.\n\nFor example, there might be a \"Set Variable\" node and a \"Get Variable\" node.\n\nSo, in the loop, after adding the current item to the sum, set the \"sum\" variable to the new value.\n\nThen, in the next iteration, get the current value of \"sum\", add the next item, and set it again.\n\nFinally, after the loop, get the value of \"sum\" and output it.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me consider which approach is better:\n\n- Using \"Iteration.Reduce\": simpler, less error-prone, and likely more efficient.\n\n- Using \"Std.For\" with variable assignment: more manual, but still achievable.\n\nGiven the choice, I'll prefer \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nBut to ensure that it works correctly, I should verify its behavior.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Reduce\" applies the reducer function cumulatively to the elements of the array, starting from the initial value, this should precisely compute the sum.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Create a new function module named \"SumArray\".\n\n2. Define an input node for the array.\n\n3. Instantiate an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node.\n\n4. Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n5. Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n6. Set the initial value to zero.\n\n7. Define an output node connected to the output of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should give me the sum of the array.\n\nI should also consider the data types. Assuming the array contains numbers, and the sum should be a number, this should work fine.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Empty array: should return zero.\n\n- Array with one element: should return that element.\n\n- Array with negative numbers: should handle negatives correctly.\n\n- Array with floating-point numbers: should handle decimals correctly.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Math.Add\" node can handle floating-point numbers if necessary.\n\nAssuming \"Math.Add\" supports numbers in general, including floats, this should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to define a new module for this function.\n\nIn Midio, modules seem to be defined with positions (x, y coordinates), and nodes are connected via links.\n\nEach node has inputs and outputs, and data flows from one node to another.\n\nSo, in my \"SumArray\" module, I'll have:\n\n- An input node for the array.\n\n- An instance of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Connections from the array input to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s \"items\" input.\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- An output node connected to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s output.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct node names and connections as per Midio's syntax.\n\nGiven that, here's a rough sketch of what the module definition might look like:\n\nmodule() SumArray {\n\n    in(x: 0, y: 0, name: \"array\") property(Array) array_input\n\n    out(x: 200, y: 0, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_output\n\n    instance(x: 100, y: 0) reduce root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\n        reducer: root.Std.Math.Add\n\n        initial_value: 0\n\n    }\n\n    array_input -> reduce.items\n\n    reduce.output -> sum_output\n\n}\n\nThis is a simplified representation. The actual syntax might require more details, such as specifying data types or handling triggers for execution.\n\nI should also consider how the function is executed. Maybe there's an execute trigger that needs to be connected appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the \"Iteration.Reduce\" node correctly accumulates the sum by applying \"Math.Add\" to each element starting from zero.\n\nIf \"Iteration.Reduce\" doesn't support setting the reducer function directly, I might need to create an instance of \"Math.Add\" and pass it as the reducer.\n\nFor example:\n\ninstance(x: 50, y: 50) add root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\nThen, connect this add instance to the reduce node's reducer input.\n\nWait, perhaps the reducer is a function that takes two arguments and returns their addition.\n\nIn that case, I need to provide a function that adds two numbers.\n\nIn Midio, functions might be passed as references to nodes or instances.\n\nAssuming that \"Math.Add\" can be used as the reducer function, I can connect it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" expects a specific type of function, I might need to adapt \"Math.Add\" to match that expectation.\n\nThis could get complicated, so perhaps starting with \"Iteration.Reduce\" is a good approach, but I should be prepared to fallback to a manual loop if necessary.\n\nLet me consider how to implement the sum using a \"Std.For\" loop.\n\nIn this case:\n\n1. Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each element in the array.\n\n3. In each iteration, add the current element to \"sum\" and update \"sum\".\n\n4. After the loop, output the final value of \"sum\".\n\nTo manage the \"sum\" variable, I might need \"Set Variable\" and \"Get Variable\" nodes.\n\nAssuming that, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Set Variable node to initialize sum to zero.\n\n- Std.For node to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the current sum.\n\n- Math.Add node to add the current item to the sum.\n\n- Set Variable node to update sum with the new value.\n\n- After the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the final sum.\n\n- Output it.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but it should work.\n\nCompar"

                "I need to create a function that rotates a given list by a specified number of items to the right direction. This means that the last n elements of the list should be moved to the beginning of the list, where n is the specified number of rotations.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate the list to the right.\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the remaining elements.\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order, so that the last n elements become the first, and the remaining elements follow.\n\nFor example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation count is 2, the function should return [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].\n\nI need to handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length. In such cases, the effective rotation can be found by taking the rotation count modulo the list length.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll create a function called rotateRight that takes two inputs: the list to rotate and the number of positions to rotate.\n\nI'll need to calculate the effective rotation count by taking the rotation count modulo the length of the list. This will handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, I'll split the list into two parts:\n\n- The last n elements.\n\n- The remaining elements from the start to the (length - n) position.\n\nFinally, I'll concatenate these two parts, with the last n elements coming first, followed by the remaining elements.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty list or a rotation count of 0, which should return the list unchanged.\n\nLet me sketch this out in pseudocode:\n\nfunction rotateRight(list, rotationCount):\n\nif list is empty or rotationCount is 0:\n\nreturn list\n\neffectiveRotation = rotationCount % length of list\n\nif effectiveRotation == 0:\n\nreturn list\n\nsplitPoint = length of list - effectiveRotation\n\nrotatedList = concatenate(list from splitPoint to end, list from start to splitPoint)\n\nreturn rotatedList\n\nNow, I need to translate this logic into Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need the following nodes:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to calculate the effective rotation.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nI should also handle the case where the rotation count is 0 or the list is empty, in which case I can directly return the list.\n\nLet me think about how to wire these nodes together.\n\nFirst, check if the list is empty or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list as is.\n\nOtherwise, calculate the effective rotation: rotationCount modulo list length.\n\nIf effective rotation is 0, output the list as is.\n\nElse, determine the split point: list length minus effective rotation.\n\nUse List.Slice to get the last n elements (from splitPoint to end).\n\nUse List.Slice again to get the remaining elements (from start to splitPoint).\n\nUse List.Concat to concatenate the last n elements with the remaining elements.\n\nOutput the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, to get the last n elements, start = length - n, end = length.\n\nTo get the first part, start = 0, end = length - n.\n\nI should also consider negative rotation counts. If rotationCount is negative, it should rotate to the left.\n\nBut since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nHowever, to make the function more robust, I can take the absolute value of rotationCount.\n\nWait, but the task says \"to the right direction\", so I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nIf rotationCount is negative, perhaps I should treat it as rotating to the left, but to keep it simple, I'll assume it's non-negative.\n\nLet me proceed with rotationCount being non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider an example.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 2\n\nlength: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5] (indices 3 to 5)\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3] (indices 0 to 3)\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 0\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 5 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 7\n\neffectiveRotation: 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5]\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, let's consider an empty list:\n\nList: []\n\nrotationCount: any value\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 0? Need to handle division by zero.\n\nIn Midio, List.Length of an empty list is 0.\n\nSo, effectiveRotation = rotationCount % 0. But modulo operation with 0 should be handled carefully.\n\nIn programming, n % 0 is undefined, but in practice, it might return n or raise an error.\n\nTo handle this, I'll add a condition: if list length is 0, return the empty list immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if rotationCount is 0, return the list as is.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function called rotateRight with inputs: list and rotationCount.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Check if list length is 0 or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list.\n\n- Otherwise, calculate effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- If effectiveRotation is 0, output the list.\n\n- Else, calculate splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate last n elements with remaining elements.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\nFor remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen concatenate them in that order.\n\nI should also consider if rotationCount is larger than list length.\n\nBut since I'm using modulo operation, effectiveRotation will be within 0 to listLength - 1.\n\nSo, it should handle cases where rotationCount > listLength correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this logic step by step in Midio.\n\nFirst, get the list length using List.Length.\n\nThen, compute effectiveRotation using Math.Modulo with rotationCount and listLength.\n\nThen, check if effectiveRotation is 0. If so, output the original list.\n\nOtherwise, compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\nThen, use List.Slice twice:\n\n- Once for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Once for remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen, use List.Concat to concatenate these two slices in the order: last n elements first, then remaining elements.\n\nFinally, output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to ensure that all paths lead to an output.\n\nAlso, handle the case where listLength is 0 to avoid division by zero in modulo operation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use conditional logic with If nodes to handle these cases.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- Conditional checks using If nodes to handle cases where listLength is 0 or effectiveRotation is 0.\n\n- Math.Subtract to compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- List.Slice to get the two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate them.\n\n- Output the result.\n\nLet me sketch this in a more detailed step-by-step manner.\n\n1. Get listLength using List.Length on the input list.\n\n2. Check if listLength == 0 or rotationCount == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Compute effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength using Math.Modulo.\n\n4. Check if effectiveRotation == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 5.\n\n5. Compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation using Math.Subtract.\n\n6. Use List.Slice to get last n elements:\n\n- Start index: splitPoint\n\n- End index: listLength"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I need to create a function that calculates the sum of an array. Since I'm working with Midio, which seems to be a node-based programming language, I'll have to design this functionality using nodes and connections.\n\nFirst, I should understand what inputs and outputs this function will have. The input is an array of numbers, and the output should be the sum of those numbers, which is a single number.\n\nIn Midio, functions are likely defined as modules or specific node configurations that can be reused. So, I need to create a module that takes an array as input and outputs the sum.\n\nI'll probably need to iterate over the array, adding each element to a running total. For this, I might need a loop construct, perhaps something like a \"for\" loop node, and a node to handle addition.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved:\n\n1. Start with an initial sum of zero.\n\n2. Iterate through each element in the array.\n\n3. Add each element to the running sum.\n\n4. Once all elements have been added, output the sum.\n\nI need to find nodes that can help me achieve this. From the list of external functions provided, there's a \"Std.For\" node that seems useful for iterating over a list. There's also a \"Math.Add\" node that can be used to add numbers.\n\nSo, I can set up a \"Std.For\" node to iterate over the array. Inside the loop, I'll use a \"Math.Add\" node to add each element to a running total.\n\nI might need a way to keep track of the running sum across iterations. Perhaps there's a node for accumulating values or maintaining state within the loop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a reduce function or something similar that can apply a function to all elements of an array and accumulate the result.\n\nLooking back at the list of external functions, there's an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node. This sounds perfect for summing an array because it applies a function to each element and accumulates the result.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" where the function is \"Math.Add\", and the initial value is zero.\n\nLet me consider how to set this up:\n\n- Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- The output of \"Iteration.Reduce\" would be the sum of the array.\n\nThis seems straightforward. I need to make sure that \"Iteration.Reduce\" works by accumulating the sum correctly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available or doesn't work as expected, I can fall back to using a \"Std.For\" loop and manually accumulate the sum.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop, use \"Math.Add\" to add the current item to a running total.\n\n- Keep track of the running total across iterations.\n\n- After the loop finishes, output the final sum.\n\nBut using \"Iteration.Reduce\" seems more efficient and cleaner.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty array. In that case, the sum should be zero, which aligns with the initial value.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\n- Create a new function module called \"SumArray\".\n\n- Define an input for the array.\n\n- Use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with \"Math.Add\" as the reducer and initial value zero.\n\n- Output the result from \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should work.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" isn't available, I can use \"Std.For\" and accumulate the sum manually.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n- Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each item in the array.\n\n- In each iteration, add the current item to \"sum\".\n\n- After the loop, output \"sum\".\n\nI need to figure out how to manage variables and state in Midio. Perhaps there are nodes for variable assignment and retrieval.\n\nFor example, there might be a \"Set Variable\" node and a \"Get Variable\" node.\n\nSo, in the loop, after adding the current item to the sum, set the \"sum\" variable to the new value.\n\nThen, in the next iteration, get the current value of \"sum\", add the next item, and set it again.\n\nFinally, after the loop, get the value of \"sum\" and output it.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me consider which approach is better:\n\n- Using \"Iteration.Reduce\": simpler, less error-prone, and likely more efficient.\n\n- Using \"Std.For\" with variable assignment: more manual, but still achievable.\n\nGiven the choice, I'll prefer \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nBut to ensure that it works correctly, I should verify its behavior.\n\nAssuming \"Iteration.Reduce\" applies the reducer function cumulatively to the elements of the array, starting from the initial value, this should precisely compute the sum.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Create a new function module named \"SumArray\".\n\n2. Define an input node for the array.\n\n3. Instantiate an \"Iteration.Reduce\" node.\n\n4. Connect the array input to the \"items\" input of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n5. Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n6. Set the initial value to zero.\n\n7. Define an output node connected to the output of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\nThis should give me the sum of the array.\n\nI should also consider the data types. Assuming the array contains numbers, and the sum should be a number, this should work fine.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- Empty array: should return zero.\n\n- Array with one element: should return that element.\n\n- Array with negative numbers: should handle negatives correctly.\n\n- Array with floating-point numbers: should handle decimals correctly.\n\nI need to make sure that the \"Math.Add\" node can handle floating-point numbers if necessary.\n\nAssuming \"Math.Add\" supports numbers in general, including floats, this should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Midio's node-based structure.\n\nI need to define a new module for this function.\n\nIn Midio, modules seem to be defined with positions (x, y coordinates), and nodes are connected via links.\n\nEach node has inputs and outputs, and data flows from one node to another.\n\nSo, in my \"SumArray\" module, I'll have:\n\n- An input node for the array.\n\n- An instance of \"Iteration.Reduce\".\n\n- Connections from the array input to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s \"items\" input.\n\n- Set the reducer function to \"Math.Add\".\n\n- Set the initial value to zero.\n\n- An output node connected to \"Iteration.Reduce\"'s output.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm using the correct node names and connections as per Midio's syntax.\n\nGiven that, here's a rough sketch of what the module definition might look like:\n\nmodule() SumArray {\n\n    in(x: 0, y: 0, name: \"array\") property(Array) array_input\n\n    out(x: 200, y: 0, name: \"sum\") property(Number) sum_output\n\n    instance(x: 100, y: 0) reduce root.Iteration.Reduce {\n\n        reducer: root.Std.Math.Add\n\n        initial_value: 0\n\n    }\n\n    array_input -> reduce.items\n\n    reduce.output -> sum_output\n\n}\n\nThis is a simplified representation. The actual syntax might require more details, such as specifying data types or handling triggers for execution.\n\nI should also consider how the function is executed. Maybe there's an execute trigger that needs to be connected appropriately.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that the \"Iteration.Reduce\" node correctly accumulates the sum by applying \"Math.Add\" to each element starting from zero.\n\nIf \"Iteration.Reduce\" doesn't support setting the reducer function directly, I might need to create an instance of \"Math.Add\" and pass it as the reducer.\n\nFor example:\n\ninstance(x: 50, y: 50) add root.Std.Math.Add {}\n\nThen, connect this add instance to the reduce node's reducer input.\n\nWait, perhaps the reducer is a function that takes two arguments and returns their addition.\n\nIn that case, I need to provide a function that adds two numbers.\n\nIn Midio, functions might be passed as references to nodes or instances.\n\nAssuming that \"Math.Add\" can be used as the reducer function, I can connect it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Iteration.Reduce\" expects a specific type of function, I might need to adapt \"Math.Add\" to match that expectation.\n\nThis could get complicated, so perhaps starting with \"Iteration.Reduce\" is a good approach, but I should be prepared to fallback to a manual loop if necessary.\n\nLet me consider how to implement the sum using a \"Std.For\" loop.\n\nIn this case:\n\n1. Initialize a variable \"sum\" to zero before the loop.\n\n2. Use \"Std.For\" to iterate over each element in the array.\n\n3. In each iteration, add the current element to \"sum\" and update \"sum\".\n\n4. After the loop, output the final value of \"sum\".\n\nTo manage the \"sum\" variable, I might need \"Set Variable\" and \"Get Variable\" nodes.\n\nAssuming that, here's a rough outline:\n\n- Set Variable node to initialize sum to zero.\n\n- Std.For node to iterate over the array.\n\n- Inside the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the current sum.\n\n- Math.Add node to add the current item to the sum.\n\n- Set Variable node to update sum with the new value.\n\n- After the loop:\n\n- Get Variable node to get the final sum.\n\n- Output it.\n\nThis seems a bit involved, but it should work.\n\nCompar"

This means that the last n elements of the list should be moved to the beginning of the list, where n is the specified number of rotations.\n\nTo achieve this, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of positions to rotate the list to the right.\n2. Split the list into two parts: the last n elements and the remaining elements.\n3. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order, so that the last n elements become the first, and the remaining elements follow.\n\nFor example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the rotation count is 2, the function should return [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].\n\nI need to handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length. In such cases, the effective rotation can be found by taking the rotation count modulo the list length.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Midio.\n\nFirst, I'll create a function called rotateRight that takes two inputs: the list to rotate and the number of positions to rotate.\n\nI'll need to calculate the effective rotation count by taking the rotation count modulo the length of the list. This will handle cases where the rotation count is larger than the list length.\n\nThen, I'll split the list into two parts:\n\n- The last n elements.\n\n- The remaining elements from the start to the (length - n) position.\n\nFinally, I'll concatenate these two parts, with the last n elements coming first, followed by the remaining elements.\n\nI should also consider edge cases, such as an empty list or a rotation count of 0, which should return the list unchanged.\n\nLet me sketch this out in pseudocode:\n\nfunction rotateRight(list, rotationCount):\n\nif list is empty or rotationCount is 0:\n\nreturn list\n\neffectiveRotation = rotationCount % length of list\n\nif effectiveRotation == 0:\n\nreturn list\n\nsplitPoint = length of list - effectiveRotation\n\nrotatedList = concatenate(list from splitPoint to end, list from start to splitPoint)\n\nreturn rotatedList\n\nNow, I need to translate this logic into Midio nodes.\n\nI'll need the following nodes:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to calculate the effective rotation.\n\n- List.Slice to split the list into two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate the two parts.\n\nI should also handle the case where the rotation count is 0 or the list is empty, in which case I can directly return the list.\n\nLet me think about how to wire these nodes together.\n\nFirst, check if the list is empty or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list as is.\n\nOtherwise, calculate the effective rotation: rotationCount modulo list length.\n\nIf effective rotation is 0, output the list as is.\n\nElse, determine the split point: list length minus effective rotation.\n\nUse List.Slice to get the last n elements (from splitPoint to end).\n\nUse List.Slice again to get the remaining elements (from start to splitPoint).\n\nUse List.Concat to concatenate the last n elements with the remaining elements.\n\nOutput the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, to get the last n elements, start = length - n, end = length.\n\nTo get the first part, start = 0, end = length - n.\n\nI should also consider negative rotation counts. If rotationCount is negative, it should rotate to the left.\n\nBut since the task specifies rotating to the right, I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nHowever, to make the function more robust, I can take the absolute value of rotationCount.\n\nWait, but the task says \"to the right direction\", so I'll assume rotationCount is non-negative.\n\nIf rotationCount is negative, perhaps I should treat it as rotating to the left, but to keep it simple, I'll assume it's non-negative.\n\nLet me proceed with rotationCount being non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider an example.\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 2\n\nlength: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 2 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5] (indices 3 to 5)\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3] (indices 0 to 3)\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nLooks correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 0\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 5\n\neffectiveRotation: 5 % 5 = 0\n\nreturn the list as is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAnother example:\n\nList: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nrotationCount: 7\n\neffectiveRotation: 7 % 5 = 2\n\nsplitPoint: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nlast n elements: [4, 5]\n\nremaining elements: [1, 2, 3]\n\nconcatenated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow, let's consider an empty list:\n\nList: []\n\nrotationCount: any value\n\neffectiveRotation: 0 % 0? Need to handle division by zero.\n\nIn Midio, List.Length of an empty list is 0.\n\nSo, effectiveRotation = rotationCount % 0. But modulo operation with 0 should be handled carefully.\n\nIn programming, n % 0 is undefined, but in practice, it might return n or raise an error.\n\nTo handle this, I'll add a condition: if list length is 0, return the empty list immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if rotationCount is 0, return the list as is.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Midio.\n\nI'll need to create a function called rotateRight with inputs: list and rotationCount.\n\nInside the function:\n\n- Check if list length is 0 or rotationCount is 0. If so, output the list.\n\n- Otherwise, calculate effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- If effectiveRotation is 0, output the list.\n\n- Else, calculate splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Use List.Slice to get remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\n- Use List.Concat to concatenate last n elements with remaining elements.\n\n- Output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to make sure that the indices are correctly handled in List.Slice.\n\nIn Midio, List.Slice takes start and end indices, where end is exclusive.\n\nSo, for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\nFor remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen concatenate them in that order.\n\nI should also consider if rotationCount is larger than list length.\n\nBut since I'm using modulo operation, effectiveRotation will be within 0 to listLength - 1.\n\nSo, it should handle cases where rotationCount > listLength correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this logic step by step in Midio.\n\nFirst, get the list length using List.Length.\n\nThen, compute effectiveRotation using Math.Modulo with rotationCount and listLength.\n\nThen, check if effectiveRotation is 0. If so, output the original list.\n\nOtherwise, compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\nThen, use List.Slice twice:\n\n- Once for last n elements: start = splitPoint, end = listLength.\n\n- Once for remaining elements: start = 0, end = splitPoint.\n\nThen, use List.Concat to concatenate these two slices in the order: last n elements first, then remaining elements.\n\nFinally, output the concatenated list.\n\nI need to ensure that all paths lead to an output.\n\nAlso, handle the case where listLength is 0 to avoid division by zero in modulo operation.\n\nIn Midio, I can use conditional logic with If nodes to handle these cases.\n\nSo, I'll need:\n\n- List.Length to get the length of the list.\n\n- Math.Modulo to compute rotationCount % listLength.\n\n- Conditional checks using If nodes to handle cases where listLength is 0 or effectiveRotation is 0.\n\n- Math.Subtract to compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation.\n\n- List.Slice to get the two parts.\n\n- List.Concat to concatenate them.\n\n- Output the result.\n\nLet me sketch this in a more detailed step-by-step manner.\n\n1. Get listLength using List.Length on the input list.\n\n2. Check if listLength == 0 or rotationCount == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Compute effectiveRotation = rotationCount % listLength using Math.Modulo.\n\n4. Check if effectiveRotation == 0.\n\n- If true, output the original list.\n\n- If false, proceed to step 5.\n\n5. Compute splitPoint = listLength - effectiveRotation using Math.Subtract.\n\n6. Use List.Slice to get last n elements:\n\n- Start index: splitPoint\n\n- End index: listLength"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"

                "I'm trying to solve this problem: \"Create a function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.\"\n\nSo, I need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unique numbers\" means. Does it mean numbers that appear only once in the list, or does it mean all distinct numbers regardless of their frequency?\n\nLet me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Unique as in distinct: All different numbers in the list, even if some appear multiple times.\n\n2. Unique as in appearing only once: Only numbers that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more likely, where unique means distinct, so I should calculate the product of all distinct numbers in the list.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nStarting with the first interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify all distinct numbers.\n\n- Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the distinct numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.\n\nNow, for the second interpretation:\n\n- Take a list of numbers.\n\n- Identify numbers that appear only once.\n\n- Calculate the product of these numbers.\n\nFor example, given the list [2, 3, 4, 5, 5], the numbers that appear only once are 2, 3, 4, and the product would be 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation to go with. Since the problem says \"unique numbers,\" it's probably referring to distinct numbers, not necessarily those that appear only once.\n\nSo, I'll proceed with the first interpretation: unique means distinct.\n\nNow, how do I implement this in code?\n\nI need to:\n\n1. Take a list of numbers as input.\n\n2. Find all distinct numbers in the list.\n\n3. Calculate the product of these distinct numbers.\n\nIn programming terms:\n\n- Use a data structure to store unique numbers, like a set.\n\n- Iterate through the list, adding each number to the set.\n\n- Then, iterate through the set and calculate the product.\n\nAlternatively, in some programming languages, there might be built-in functions to get unique elements and calculate products.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to write a function, I need to define it properly.\n\nAlso, I should consider edge cases:\n\n- Empty list: What's the product of an empty set? Conventionally, it's 1.\n\n- List with zeros: If there's a zero in the list, the product will be zero.\n\n- Negative numbers: The product should handle negative numbers correctly.\n\n- Duplicates: Make sure duplicates are ignored.\n\nLet me sketch a rough plan:\n\nDefine a function, say, productOfUniqueNumbers(list):\n\nif list is empty:\n\nreturn 1\n\ncreate an empty set, uniqueNumbers\n\nfor each number in list:\n\nadd number to uniqueNumbers\n\ninitialize product to 1\n\nfor each number in uniqueNumbers:\n\nproduct *= number\n\nreturn product\n\nNow, let's think about implementation in a specific programming language.\n\nSince the problem didn't specify the language, I'll assume it's a language that supports basic data structures like sets and lists.\n\nBut in Midio, which is a node-based programming language, I need to think differently.\n\nI need to represent this logic using nodes and connections.\n\nSo, in Midio, I would have:\n\n- An input node for the list.\n\n- A node to get unique elements from the list.\n\n- A node to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\n- An output node for the result.\n\nI need to familiarize myself with Midio's available nodes that can handle lists and mathematical operations.\n\nLooking back at the provided external functions, I see nodes like List.Unique, Math.Mul, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the initial message, the list of external functions is provided. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- List.Empty\n\n- List.GetAt\n\n- List.Add\n\n- List.Remove\n\n- List.Length\n\n- List.Contains\n\n- List.Sort\n\n- List.Max\n\n- List.Min\n\n- List.Slice\n\n- List.Reversed\n\n- List.FirstItem\n\n- List.LastItem\n\n- List.IsEmpty\n\n- List.NotEmpty\n\n- List.Flatten\n\n- List.Concat\n\n- Query.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Map\n\n- Iteration.Zip\n\n- Iteration.Filter\n\n- Iteration.Reduce\n\n- Iteration.Find\n\n- Math.Floor\n\n- Math.Add\n\n- Math.Sub\n\n- Math.Mul\n\n- Math.Div\n\n- Math.GreaterThan\n\n- Math.LessThanOrEqual\n\n- Math.Expression\n\n- Math.Pow\n\n- Math.Modulo\n\n- Math.Min\n\n- Logic.Equal\n\n- Logic.NotEqual\n\n- Logic.Not\n\n- Logic.And\n\n- Sets.Intersection\n\n- Sets.Difference\n\nHmm, there's no direct \"List.Unique\" node, which would be helpful.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to get unique elements from a list using the available nodes.\n\nOne way to get unique elements is to iterate through the list and add each element to a set, then convert the set back to a list.\n\nBut in Midio, since it's node-based, I need to find nodes that can help me achieve this.\n\nLooking at the nodes, I see \"Sets.Difference,\" but that might not be directly helpful for getting unique elements.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if an element has already been seen.\n\nBut implementing a filter with state (to keep track of seen elements) might be tricky in a node-based language without mutable state.\n\nAlternatively, I can sort the list and then iterate through it, picking only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\nBut this would require sorting the list first, which might not be the most efficient approach, but it's doable.\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the input list using \"List.Sort.\"\n\n2. Iterate through the sorted list and pick only elements that are not equal to the previous one.\n\n3. Collect these unique elements into a new list.\n\n4. Then, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with a multiplier function to calculate the product of these unique elements.\n\nLet me think about step 2 in more detail.\n\nAfter sorting, duplicate elements will be adjacent.\n\nSo, I can iterate through the sorted list and pick only the first occurrence of each element.\n\nIn a node-based language, this might involve keeping track of the previous element, which could be challenging without mutable state.\n\nMaybe I can use \"Iteration.Zip\" to pair each element with its predecessor, then filter out those pairs where the elements are equal.\n\nWait, but zip requires two lists: the sorted list and a shifted version of itself.\n\nI can create a shifted version by slicing the list: one from index 0 and one from index 1.\n\nThen, zip them and filter where the elements are not equal.\n\nBut I need to handle the first element separately because it doesn't have a predecessor.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use \"Iteration.Find\" to find the first occurrence of each element, but that might not be straightforward either.\n\nAnother approach: Use \"Iteration.Map\" to create a new list where each element is marked as seen or not, then filter based on that.\n\nBut again, managing state in a node-based language is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider using a different strategy altogether.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use \"Sets.Difference\" between the original list and a list of duplicates to get unique elements.\n\nBut that seems convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use \"Iteration.Reduce\" to build a set of unique elements.\n\nIn Midio, if there's a way to accumulate elements into a set while checking for existence, that would work.\n\nBut again, managing state is challenging in a node-based language without mutable variables.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can use \"Iteration.Filter\" with a condition that checks if the current element exists in a subset of the list that comes before it.\n\nIf not, include it; otherwise, exclude it.\n\nThis would involve, for each element, slicing the list up to that point and checking if the element is already present.\n\nBut this sounds inefficient, especially for large lists, because it involves multiple searches within sublists.\n\nHowever, since Midio is a node-based language and efficiency might not be the primary concern here, this could be a viable approach.\n\nLet me try to outline this:\n\n- For each element in the list, get the sublist of elements before it.\n\n- Check if the current element is in that sublist.\n\n- If not, include it in the unique list.\n\nThen, once I have the unique list, use \"Iteration.Reduce\" with multiplication to calculate the product.\n\nNow, in terms of nodes:\n\n1. Input list node.\n\n2. Iteration.Filter node, where the condition is a subgraph that checks if the current element is in the preceding sublist.\n\n3. Inside the filter condition:\n\na. Get the index of the current element.\n\nb. Slice the list from the beginning up to (but not including) the current index.\n\nc. Check if the current element is in this sliced list.\n\nd. Negate the result to include only unique elements.\n\n4. Output the filtered unique list.\n\n5. Use Iteration.Reduce with a multiplier function to calculate the product of the unique list.\n\n6. Handle the edge case of an empty list by checking List.IsEmpty and returning 1 in that case.\n\nThis seems feasible, but it might be a bit involved for a simple operation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to get unique elements using available nodes"
